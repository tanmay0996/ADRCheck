Best overall creatine monohydrate powder for the price?,"I'm looking for a creatine monohydrate that is 3rd party tested, 3-5 gram servings

Supplement guidance please,"My naturopath has recommended a treatment plan which includes 6 supplements. Im feeling a bit uncomfortable with starting all 6 right off the bat. Im currently experiencing stress, high anxiety, cognition and sleep difficulty.

I noticed some of the supplements seem to target similar concerns, so my thinking is: why not start with 3–4 (like one for anxiety, one for sleep, etc.) and then add others later if needed? That way I can actually tell what's helping and avoid unnecessary side effects.

Supplements recommended:

\- Ashwagandha

\- Magnesium bisglycenate

\- Omega 3 w/Vit D

\- Gaba-T-SAP

\- Cortico-Calm Matrix

\- Mitochondrial Formula (Bioclinic)

Stack advice,"Hello. I've been wanting to post something for awhile, but have feared that you'll all think I'm nuts. 
Quick background: 55 year old man, had the trifecta (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) for about 20 years.

Started a massive amount of supplements to address energy, CV health, diabetes, cognitive health, focus, libido, ED and hormone imbalances.

Binders.,"I was on a Lyme/EBV protocol for a while from a functional doctor and was taking a LOT of stuff. I only ever felt marginally better and felt that I was being gouged so I tapered off all of it and now only take what I felt helped the most. I took a whole bottle of the CellCore BioToxin Binder and, intuitively, I feel like it (not it specifically, but a binder in general) should be helpful. I feel like there's stuff inside that needs to come out. But, I never felt anything, never saw anything, it felt like exactly nothing. If anything, my brain fog is a bit worse, though not markedly. 

I would like to keep taking a binder (I'm looking at Codeage on Amazon) but I'm not sure what I need to do to maximize it's benefit or, rather, to feel or see any effect from it at all. I don't have ready access to a sauna so that wouldn't be an option. 

One of my biggest issues is that I really don't see or feel benefits from anything I do, any body work, or supplement, or anything. I pretty much just feel the same. It's frustrating but I guess there's nothing to do but keep trying. I want to see something but maybe that's too big of an ask? Or maybe it's meant to be so gradual as to not really see much at all until months or years later. I'm not sure. If that's the case, it sure is hard to be consistent and stick to it.

So, any ideas on binders? I'm just not sure what I should be seeing or what I should be doing to maximize them. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jmoefn/binders/,1743261090.0

"Testosteron very low, please help!","Hey everyone, I recently had my bloodwork done (mostly just for fun), and what can I say—it’s pretty bad. My testosterone levels are really low for a 23-year-old athlete. I go to the gym four times a week and do 30 minutes of cardio every morning. All my nutrients and vitamins are definitely covered, and my diet is typical for a bodybuilder.

The only thing that could be suppressing my testosterone is the fact that I’m currently quite fat (20% body fat) and in a significant calorie deficit (beginning of a cut). Still, these levels are definitely not normal, and I want to do something about it.

Additionally, my estrogen is extremely low (check my full bloodwork), as well as my LH. I have two ideas:

1. Tongkat Ali
+ Better for LH and free testosterone
+ ""Safer,"" lower chance of side effects
- Doesn’t fix my extremely low estrogen, could even make it worse

2. 25mg DHEA + 10mg Pregnenolone
+ Would definitely solve my estrogen issue
+ Has the potential to be much more effective
- Might not work at all if the issue isn't related to DHEA or Pregnenolone
- Higher chance of stronger side effects and suppression of natural hormone production (though very low at this dose)

What would you recommend?

Rapid heart rate from supplements?,"Hello,

About 8 weeks ago, I suddenly developed an alarmingly fast heart rate - around 110 beats per minute at rest, which worsened when I stood up. This started after I'd been sick twice, so I suspected that might be the cause. I went to the ER, and later saw a cardiologist who confirmed there was nothing wrong with my heart. Blood tests revealed I was deficient in both iron and vitamin D. My doctor prescribed 325mg of ferrous sulfate twice daily and 4000 IU of vitamin D3 twice daily.

Only three days after starting the supplements, my heart rate began to decrease. Instead of a constant high heart rate, I only experienced occasional palpitations when tired, and even those completely disappeared about two weeks into taking the supplements. I went about four weeks without any heart issues and was getting back to normal.

However, last week I caught a common cold, and I'm not sure if it's related, but my heart rate has started climbing again. My resting heart rate is now around 100 bpm. I'm trying to figure out if this is caused by the supplements or something else.

Current medications:
- 325mg ferrous sulfate twice daily
- 2000 IU vitamin D3 twice daily
- 200mcg vitamin K2 as MK7 (I stopped taking this yesterday because I heard it can cause tachycardia)
- 240-480mg magnesium daily (mostly taking 240mg)
- Potassium chloride (prescribed by my doctor, but I only take it about 3 times per week)

Timing when taking Vitamin K2 MK7 and other tips?,"Hi everyone, I was wondering what's the best time to take K2 MK7? And other general advice or things to be aware of based on your experiences.

I have heard that it is good to take it with a fatty meal since it's fat soluble and absorption would be better. Does it matter if it's morning or evening before sleep? Also my one is 180mcg so I was wondering if I should take it once every 2-3 days as the body can store reserves of it to prevent overdosage. Some sources say 45mcg per day is sufficient.

In addition, I've got some magnesium chelate on hand in case it's needed. 200mg per pill which is about half of daily recommended. As I have heard K2 draws magnesium to efficiently allocate calcium to where it is needed. I get a decent amount of magnesium in diet but not a lot so I got some pills as insurance. I also have the standard 1000UI D3 pills but I do eat a decent amount of wild alaskan canned salmon so that's covered too. Should I take these once every 2 days or a couple times a week? And together with K2 or at other times?

Just as context, the reason why I am taking it is because of Weston Price's work on dental health and his discovery of K2 as the missing ingredient in modern diets. My diet has pretty much everything except K2 which is really hard to get. It includes a balanced amount of meat, fish, fruit, veg and some dairy. No grains or cereals at all, I get complex starchy carbs from sweet potato/potato. I haven't been to a restaurant in 5 years and cook all my meals. I am in my mid-20's and firmly believe that prevention is better than cure, but at the same time don't want to overdo it as I am young and pretty healthy overall. Apologies if too much detail.

I’m willing to try anything to get myself to calm down.. Is it safe for me to try it while taking an SSRI daily?

Fixed my years long isolated systolic high blood pressure by stopping magnesium!?,"So for the first time in about 4-5 years, my blood pressure is in the 115/70 range. I’ve tried many diets, weight loss, anything under the sun, even blood pressure meds, and nothing worked. I’ve tried drinking a lot of coconut water and eating potatoes to see if getting 5000-7000g of potassium would work as well, and it didn’t. I’ve tried lower sodium diets (worst idea ever, I think my body needs high salt intake), because my blood pressure is better if I get 4-7g of sodium a day, which apparently to “experts” is a lot. 

But in the general sense, my systolic number would always be high. Usually around 150/75. 

I came across a few magnesium supplement studies where in some people it can have negative effects. Things like depression, anxiety, irritability, anhedonia, etc, because it has something to do with stopping calcium doing its job in the pre synapses of the brain with dopamine, and also the whole system as a whole. (I’m one of those people, but that’s nothing to do with the post) 

Ive been taking magnesium non stop for about 5 years now, and never really took a break from it. Apart from a day here and there once every 2 months maybe. This was due to hearing people always say that everyone is basically deficient in magnesium, etc, etc. 
ive done blood tests every 3 months to monitor my electrolytes and everything was always good.

Going back to the former point about the side effects magnesium supplements have on some individuals, I’ve decided to just take a break from magnesium for 30 days and see what happens. I’ve got a great deal of benefits from stopping the supplement after about 5-7 days, and a few minors drawbacks, but the most unexpected result i got was my blood pressure finally normalising. My blood pressure has been perfect for 2 weeks straight. 

My question is, why stopping magnesium supplements has fixed my blood pressure? 
Obviously magnesium is essential, and I have no problems with foods that contain large amounts. But could there be a possibility that blood tests don’t show the whole picture, and that the body does indeed store magnesium for longer period of time than we believe, and that overfilling those stores can cause more harm than good? 

Ps. I’ve never taken more than 50-70% of daily requirements, and I’ve tried every form, along with thiamine.

I considered it could mean 5 or 14 droppers but that seems like a lot whereas 5 drops doesn't seem like very much.

Supplements for circulation / healing?,"I’m currently dealing with pain on the left side of my ribs. The doctors and I haven’t come to a conclusion on what is causing it yet, but it’s been happening for two months.

Get lots of Omega 3 from my diet but not** Omega 6,"The assumption is that the ""standard american diet"" provides plenty Omega 6 but not enough Omega 3 and I'm finding the inverse true.  
  
I've been tracking my food intake very accurately (weighing all portions outside of holiday meals etc) for around the past year and I use the Cronometer app specifically to track my micronutrients. I know there's always some room for error but my levels of Omega 3 are *always* in a healthy range, whereas my Omega 6 levels are *consistently* low. I started supplementing about six months ago for the areas I'm falling short, but it's impossible to find Omega 6 supplements because the assumption is that the standard american diet provides more than enough of that.

Except clearly I don't eat the standard american diet! Lol.

I eat fairly low carb, hardly any processed stuff because of that (I do a lot of my own baking for crackers and cookies and such and don't eat breads, cereals, or pasta, etc.), so what can I eat to increase Omega 6 but NOT Omega 3 since I already get plenty of that, which won't affect my diet preferences?

For the record the reason I eat with such carb restriction is because I have IBS and carby foods pretty reliably give me diarrhea, so I just generally stay away from them and it solves 90% of my stomach issues. (And yes I've tried gluten free, been tested for various things, eat plenty of fiber (chia seeds daily - that's where I get the Omega 3), I've tried cutting out this and that...processed grain carbs are almost always the culprit and cutting them out the fix so please no lectures about how carbs aren't the devil, I know they aren't for most people, but for me they unfortunately seem to be.)

Chronic pain,"Hello friends! Tons of posts and threads and blogs but I trust Reddit frankly more than “articles” because I get real anecdotes.

I have chronic lower back and upper neck pain from slipped discs. I may have fibromyalgia too as it’s on my dad’s side but from what I understand/confirmed by my docs that’s more of a “diagnosis of exclusion” because it’s not a really well understood or “believed” disease. I had surgery for a spinal cord stimulator that worked WONDERS in dropping it from a 8/10 to a 4-5 most days. but I have some chronic pain still that I’d love to see if non-NSAIDs can help with.

I did glucosamine and chondrotin for a while and did not see much improvement. Mine is less “joint” pain like OA, rather is more nerve/muscle related. Omega 3 did not help either so again, “arthritis” route is probably not too helpful.  was hoping on insight if anyone has tried:
Capsaicin creme - downside being is daily use required for efficacy, not as needed, which is fine but it’s pricey long term because usually comes in small bottles vs big bottles of oral supplements. Willing to try if folks convince me it’s worth it.

White willow bark

Magnesium causing Depression?,"So I am thinking about trying Magnesium-Glycinate for my anxiety and pure OCD (only intrusions).

What’s Missing in the Protein Market? Let’s Fix It Together!,"I know it's a long ahh post but pls bare with me.

I've been deep into the world of protein supplements, snacks, and powders trying out all sorts of brands, but I always feel like something is missing. Either the taste is awful, the ingredients are full of unnecessary junk, or it's just not something I actually enjoy eating.
It's not that we really care about the taste as long as it has protein in it, but when you can have it, why not right!
why settle?

Guys, guys, guys before you roll your eyes and say, ""Oh great, another one trying to start their own protein brand"", hear me out!

I believe we should have protein products that are clean, effective, and genuinely enjoyable to eat almost like a dessert but with none of the unnecessary sugar or fillers. I also want diabetic people and those who really can't have sugar or other harmful ingredients in their daily routine to have a chance at getting back to a healthier version of themselves without compromising on their protein intake.I'm thinking about creating something of my own, but before that,

I WANT TO HEAR FROM Y'All.

What do you feel is missing in the protein market? If you could create the perfect protein snack(can be any kind really-cookie/chocolate/ bite size cake) bar, or powder what would it have? What would it not have?

Think of this as a general query , or better yet, just helping a fellow gym sis out! Let's make something worth looking forward to eating.
I promise I'm not here to shove another overpriced, influencer-endorsed, air-blessed, sun-kissed"" ,""handcrafted by monks ""protein powder down your throat. I just genuinely want to make something that doesn't taste like chalk .

If we do this right, HOPEFULLY, we'll get us our own stim and non-stim pre and creatine maybe!!??!! We'll be bringing in the purest monohydrate form but with a patented mix designed to actually hit harder none of that underdosed, overhyped nonsense. Cuz God knows we all in need a Juicy anabolic one.


Also, no hate to any other brands I know I've been throwing some shade, but at the end of the day, they're all giving us something to keep us going. Respect where it's due, but let's be real... we can always push for something better.


We take all kinds of opinions,suggestions pleaseee comment away

Something to help with going back to sleep,"Tl;dr: Looking for something to help put me back to sleep in the middle of the night that isn't theanine, magnesium glycinate/taurate, or ashwagandha. 

I wake up almost every night to pee, regardless of when I stop drinking water. I don't mind the peeing that much. The problem is falling asleep again. My head starts racing. I start thinking about work and dumb life stuff. I've tried Theanine, it makes me wired. I've tried Magnesium Glycinate and Magnesium Taurate, both causes me even more insomnia. I've tried Ashwagandha, I don't feel any effects from it. I have Doxylamine Succinate, but it causes brain fog and depressive thoughtd the next day. Valerian doesn't do much in the middle of the night for me either. I'm also already doing none-supplemental stuff. Meditation doesn't help me. I exercise every day. Low caffeine and only early mornings. No light exposure when I wake up to pee. I'm typing this at 06:30 after being up since 03:10.

Magnesium Glycinate + GI Issues,"Hi all, hoping to get to the bottom of something. I normally take magnesium (200 mg) for muscle aches (I had spinal fusion years ago). It really helps me sleep and helps with headaches. I’ve used magnesium glycinate before, but it’s been a while. 

I started it back about 3 days ago and have this weird sensation in my stomach. It’s like my stomach wants to growl but doesn’t. I can’t tell if it’s a stomach ache or not but I’ve had mild nausea as well. It’s almost like a burning/reflux but nothing bad enough to cripple me (thankfully). It’s just…there. I took a 300 mg dose the first day and realized that was high considering I haven’t taken it in forever and I need to titrate up to that. So I cut it to 150 mg but am still having the issue. It sort of goes a way when I eat or chew gum and then comes back. 

I do have a history of acid reflux but otherwise no gastric issues. 

Anyone else have this problem? 

I haven’t changed anything else in my diet/supplements so I’m assuming that’s where this is coming from.

I’m not selling anything or advertising a product — just trying to understand some of the challenges that supplement brands face, especially when it comes to chargebacks and payment disputes. I'm working on a product that helps avoid chargebacks, and your input would be super valuable.

I’ve heard that chargebacks can be a real pain in this space, but I’d love to hear directly from people actually selling supplements:

* Do you run into chargebacks often?
* What are the usual reasons behind them?
* How do you deal with them or try to prevent them?
* Has it ever affected your relationship with payment processors or platforms?

Too much iodine from sea moss,"I follow a well respected surgeon on instagram who mentioned sea moss is a great source of nutrients. Read some reviews and people were praising it and I went ahead and ordered some.

I took one dose and instantly felt exhausted. Didn’t think much of it. The next day, the same thing happened. I stopped taking it and the following week I had a bunch of weird symptoms that I didn’t correlate - I was really tired, constipated, etc. I was tired enough I went for a blood test that Friday to see if I was deficient in anything. 

That weekend I went out for a friends birthday and came home hungover. I got a salad and some mangos from the store, but felt like I needed more nutrients so I took another spoonful of the sea moss. Mistake!!!!

It’s been three days and I have felt absolutely horrible. Exhausted, my thyroid is swollen to the point I had a raspy voice, I’m so thirsty, I keep drinking water. I have an ongoing headache and brain fog.

I haven’t gotten my full blood test back yet but the thyroid piece came back normal (that was before my third dose and my thyroid swelling). Still waiting on my blood test to see my iodine levels.

I can’t believe I fell for this but I’m also shocked that three doses over a period of 10 days messed me up so much. I think I just need to wait for the iodine to leave my system and from what I’ve read, it could take weeks or months to go back to normal.

Has this ever happened to anyone else? Anything I can do to get rid of the iodine faster?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jli8k4/too_much_iodine_from_sea_moss/,1743121260.0

I went to investigate because I was going to end up in the ER. My daily hair skin and nails had folic acid in and I started taking 5mg on top of that.

Does creatine really go bad?,"Found some creatine in my closet that expired in 2022. It’s basically untouched. Probably 75% full. It’s been in a cool dry spot. It’s a chalk like consistency (if I remember correctly that’s what it’s always been). I’ve been in a caloric deficit lately and have been struggling to finish my workouts. 

I feel like creatine probably doesn’t go bad so I figure I’ll save a couple bucks and then re up when I run out.

Why Ayurveda and Modern Medicine Deserve Equal Respect.,"I see people fighting on Ayurveda vs allopathy ALL THE TIME here is my experience:I’ve learned, that they both deserve their place.
Modern medicine is brilliant at tackling acute issues quickly, while Ayurveda offers long-term wellness by addressing imbalances and promoting overall health. It’s not a matter of one being better it’s about recognizing the value in both.
And when it comes to Ayurveda, I’ve learned that trusting experienced brands matters. After all, when you’re turning to centuries-old wisdom, it makes sense to choose brands that have been practicing it for just as long.That’s the whole reason after so much trial and error I have come across only a few brands that actually work.What are your opinions on this?

The Science Behind NAD+—Why It’s the Key to Energy & Longevity,"Did you know that NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is essential for energy production, brain function, and even aging? But here’s the problem—our NAD+ levels decline as we age.

🔥 Here’s what happens when NAD+ drops:  
✅ Lower energy & chronic fatigue  
✅ Increased brain fog & slower thinking  
✅ Weaker metabolism & aging skin

Luckily, there are ways to boost NAD+ naturally!  
🔹 Exercise & intermittent fasting  
🔹 Eating NAD-rich foods (avocados, salmon, etc.)  
🔹 Taking targeted supplements (NR, NMN)

I’ve done deep research on this and wrote a full breakdown. If you’re curious about how to restore your NAD+ for peak performance, [check out my article](https://medium.com/@mohammednageh1976/what-is-nad-and-why-does-it-matter-for-your-health-c3037f96c14b).

Best Multivitamin for Men? Looking for Recommendations.,"I used to take One A Day Men’s (nothing against the brand, but it’s just not working for me anymore). The main issue I’ve had is that the pills are huge, they leave a weird aftertaste, and I think they’ve been upsetting my stomach lately.

Supplements support - rookie who like to know! 💗,"Hi beautiful community. 
I’ve been researching supplements and I’ve listed the ones, I believe would be greatly beneficial for me - I have already consulted with my doctor, who unfortunately wasn’t at much help. 

Which is why I come to you ❤️ 

*Background*
- I was diagnosed with ADHD 15 years ago (now F27) and have taken the same dosis ever since. However I’ve felt the recent years that it has gotten worse, hence the listed supplements below. 
- I recently have been struggling with depression, due to several years of heavy stress. I started antidepressants, but I’d like to add some more natural (together with my existing newly healthier lifestyle) with supplements, as I believe more in  natural approaches.
- I was born with a dysfunctional thyroid gland, so I take medicine to support my metabolism.

I’d love to get your take, on the listed supplements and which I would be able to take, to support my struggles ❤️

Best NAD+ Supplements Compared: AgeShield vs. Others – Which One Works Best? 💊⚡,"https://preview.redd.it/ygfu2nnpf5re1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6de7f4ceafe9f646cf43d489f43f2507d2f868e

**Feeling exhausted, foggy, or aging faster than you'd like?** It might not be caffeine you need—it’s NAD+.

NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is **the fuel for your cells**, but after 30, your levels **crash hard** (down 50% every 20 years!). The result?  
❌ Low energy & constant fatigue 😴  
❌ Brain fog & forgetfulness 🧠  
❌ Slower metabolism & aging ⏳

Luckily, **NAD+ supplements can reverse this**—but not all are created equal. So I tested the top ones and compared results. Here’s the breakdown: 👇

# 🔥 Best NAD+ Boosters Ranked

**1️⃣ AgeShield (Nicotinamide Riboside + Pterostilbene) – 🏆 My #1 Pick**  
✔️ Uses **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**—the most research-backed NAD+ booster.  
✔️ **Enhanced absorption** with Pterostilbene (lasts longer in the body).  
✔️ **Massive energy & focus boost** (no more afternoon crashes).  
✔️ No side effects—**just clean, long-lasting vitality.**  
💰 **Price:** Mid-range, but worth it.

🔥 **My results:** Within **2 weeks**, I felt unstoppable—energy all day, crystal-clear focus, and faster workout recovery.

**2️⃣ Tru Niagen (Nicotinamide Riboside) – Solid but Overpriced**  
✔️ **Clinically proven NR formula** (patented).  
✔️ **Increases NAD+ levels, but lacks absorption boosters.**  
❌ Expensive for what it is.  
🔎 **Verdict:** *Great science, but AgeShield gives better results for less money.*

**3️⃣ NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) – Overhyped?**  
✔️ Converts into NAD+ in the body.  
✔️ Popular in anti-aging circles.  
❌ **Less research than NR (debated absorption efficiency).**  
❌ **Expensive & unstable in storage.**  
🔎 **Verdict:** *Good, but NR (AgeShield) has stronger research & results.*

**4️⃣ Niacin (Vitamin B3) – Cheap but Comes with Side Effects**  
✔️ Converts into NAD+, but takes multiple steps.  
❌ **Causes “niacin flush”** (red, itchy skin).  
❌ **High doses = liver stress risk.**  
🔎 **Verdict:** *Old-school method, but better options exist.*

# 🚀 Final Verdict: Which NAD+ Supplement is Worth It?

🏆 **Best Overall:** **AgeShield** – Highest bioavailability, best value, **no side effects.**

✅ **Pure NR + Pterostilbene = Better absorption & longer effects.**  
✅ **Immediate energy & focus boost** (no jittery caffeine crash).  
✅ **Backed by longevity research** & real results.

Aching teeth from calcium,"I’ve been on a diet for two years where I only get 10-15% daily dose calcium. So way below recommended daily intake. Two years.

I’ve been on this diet for two years due to severe intolerances.

Once I learned this I began supplementing calcium.

Now I suddenly got aching teeth.

I also got moderate feeling of pressure sometimes around jaw area

Varies from day to day.

My root canal aches the most. But various teeth aches.

My blood lab is in lower end of range but I was told by healthcare that blood lab is unreliable becuase body attempts to stabilize by taking from skeleton if too low.

It was on healthcare’s advise that I supplement given my intolerances. (We’ve tried to work with dietary but to no avail)

They haven’t instructed dosage beyond just telling me to take what I miss (the other 90%)

I’m on week two and still going on. I will ask them eventually but I feel their knowledge on supplements is pretty lacking (they just calculate and tell take this) so hence asking here.

My health wellbeing in other ways is slightly better.

Is this normal? If not, what should I do?

I’m an avid hiker who sometimes experiences anxiety when I’m on ferrata (heights) or passing through very narrow trails.

Mushroom supp makers that post complete CoAs?,"Do *any* mushroom supplement makers (or any root-based supplement makers) do complete heavy metals testing, and publish (or at least provide upon request) certificates of analysis *that include chromium testing*?

And I think most don't do it because if they *were* to test for Cr and find Prop65-exceeding levels, they would then have to either disclose that fact with a Prop65 warning (and scare away prospective buyers) or refuse all sales to California residents (and lose a ton of sales).

**Concerns/Symptoms I want to address:**   
\-Fatigue (Low energy levels or energy crashes have been an issue all my life, but I'm hoping there is something out there my body will respond to that will improve this condition without giving me heart palpitations)   
  
\-Concentration/Brain Health (This fluctuates in severity with my hormones, but Alzheimer's runs in my family so I really want to take care of my brain!)   
  
\-Night sweats/Insomnia (Hormonal/Perimenopausal)  
  
\-Cholesterol/Heart Health (Heart disease and high cholesterol also run in my family) 

\-Mood

A month ago, after a lot of research, I started taking [New Chapter's Women's Advanced Multivitamin. ](https://newchapter.com/cdn/shop/files/AWMI01SFP.jpg?v=1729796127&width=700)I don't feel any different yet, but it's only been a month, so I want to stick with it for a couple more months and see how I feel before I consider looking at other brands.   
  
Aside from my hormonal issues, my high cholesterol is hereditary and has just gotten worse with age. This week I ordered [Cholestrol Complex from Pattern Wellnes](https://patternwellness.com/cdn/shop/files/PW-CHOLEST_KBP_1_Website_3.jpg?v=1730212765&width=800)s. I hope it will help so I can avoid going on a statin in my 40s.   
  
I previously tried [Nutrametrix's Heart Health System](https://www.nutrametrix.com/product/nutrametrix-heart-health-system/?id=1329833&idType=product) last year (which I hated, because it was sooo many pills!) but after a little less than two months on it, I got bloodwork done and found my cholesterol somehow (without any change to my diet) got worse! Of course, I don't blame the pills for making things worse, but I was expecting my numbers to improve. :( Disheartened, I stopped taking them. 

While researching supplements to treat hormonal stuff, I saw a lot of people finding success with treating their hormonal imbalances and symptoms with beef organs. I ordered [Ancestral's FEM](https://ancestralsupplements.com/cdn/shop/products/23.webp?height=1000&v=1740607802) and [Adrenal supplement](https://ancestralsupplements.com/cdn/shop/files/Adrenalside2transparent.png?height=1000&v=1712248528)s (the second for brain health), then realized afterwards that might be overkill, especially since they both have Beef Liver, which is high in Vitamin A and can also raise my cholesterol levels. 

I'm feeling really overwhelmed now and wondering if trying the beef organ supplements is even an option for me with my high cholesterol, or if I should keep searching for an alternative to balance my hormones and save me from the night sweats. I would prefer to keep the pill count as low as I can, but I'm at my wit's end. 

Also, I read a lot of people have issues with Ashwagandha causing them anxiety, so I've been a bit apprehensive about taking anything with that in it as I am prone to the occasional panic attack. 

If you have read this far, thank you, kind soul. :) I appreciate any advice or recommendations you can give me! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jjzfcy/newbie_trying_to_find_the_right_balance/,1742950030.0

vitamin D 1000

Calcium 500-1000 mg 

L Citrulin 5-8 Gramms

So what do you all think ? I don’t do any meaningful sports and I eat meat around 4-5 times a week if that matters.

Am I risking on overdosing on anything? Am I taking not enough from anything?

Built a Simple Supplement Reminder iOS App,"Hey everyone,

(Mods, if this post isn’t allowed, feel free to remove it.)

I take supplements regularly, but I kept running into the same problems:
- Forgetting to take them
- Tracking my intake progress

I wanted a simple, clean app that just helps with reminders and tracking—nothing bloated, no giant database of supplements—just an easy way to stay consistent. So I built Suppl

It’s designed the UI to be minimal and straightforward:
- Set reminders for each supplement
- Log doses quickly
- Nice UI to view history
- Gamify progress with streaks 

I’d love to hear from others who take supplements:
- What features would make this more useful for you?
- Any frustrations with existing tracking apps?

I think i have very low dopamine. Help?,"Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. Shortly after i noticed some unpleasant things. At first i thought they were just withdrawal symptoms, and i believed that was the entire issue, but now that it has stabilised and i feel 0 cravings, i am starting to suspect there might be more to it.

My therapist has brought up the possibility of me having ADHD and suggested to pursue further testing.

What i noticed since quitting:

* ⁠Lots of anxiety/panic attacks 
* ⁠Absolutely no motivation to keep up hobbies i had
* Zero motivation at work 
* ⁠Fatigue, apathy, tiredness 
* Lower (almost no) libido 
* ⁠Lost interest in socialising

All of this is very unusual for me. Sure, i’ve always had bad days, sometimes i’d be anxious or be a bit sad. But ever since quitting i feel much worse mentally. I used to go out on the weekends, take long car trips just because i wanted to take some photos, i loved going out to restaurants even if alone. But now i just don’t feel the need to do any of that. I go to work, go to the gym, rot at home, go to bed. And repeat. I even lost any desire to play videogames, which is something i liked to do from time to time. 

This is extremely unusual for me, and i am looking on ways to “boost” my dopamine or at least bring it up a bit, because i feel like i’m just existing through the days waiting for motivation to come back.

Known deficiencies: 

* ⁠low Vitamin D: 14 ng/mL (ref range 30 - 100) •	⁠low folates: 2.20 ng/ml (ref range >4.60)

Supplements:

* ⁠Vitamin D (4000 IU/day); Folic acid 5mg/day, High dose vit B complex (B1, B6, B12), Mag glycinate.

Edit to add: I quit in order to become healthier, not because i had problems regulating myself. I'd smoke weed in the evening before bed (3/4 puffs) and on sunday morning (a bit more). As for alcohol, i was drinking to the point of being drunk once per month, tipsy twice per month. With the occasional beer here and there.

As for coffee, i never went over two small espresso cups (30 ml) of coffe, so only abput 100mg of caffeine at most. i do not believe i am suffering withdrawals, i believe i am struggling with the absence of dopamine.

This is my attempt at living completely sober, and it's not going great.

Edit2: i exercise, i go to the gym and do cardio. I eat well and have lost 40lbs since November, so at least i know it’s not food induced",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jjkegs/i_think_i_have_very_low_dopamine_help/,1742912212.0

Antioxidants - your body is rusting like metals,"I hear here and there that this supplement have Antioxidant effect etc, but I always wonder how can we see the effect. Then I asked AI to ELI5 and I like the words that came our, your body is rusting, here

>Imagine your body is like a metal car. Over time, rust (called ""oxidative damage"" in your body) starts to form from things like pollution, sunlight, and even just using the car.

>Antioxidants are like a special wax or protective coating that slows down or stops the rust from forming. They do this by neutralizing the ""rust-causing"" things, which are called ""free radicals.""

>So, antioxidants help protect your body's cells from damage, keeping them healthier for longer!

Again I asked ELI5 what are free radicals

>Imagine tiny, bouncy, angry balls inside your body. These balls are called ""free radicals.""

>**Angry and Unstable:** They're ""angry"" because they're missing a tiny piece (an electron) and they want to steal it from something else.

>**Damage Causing:** When they steal that piece, they damage the thing they stole from, like your cells or DNA.

>**Chain Reaction:** Then, the thing they stole from becomes an angry ball too, and it steals from something else, starting a chain reaction of damage.

>**From Everyday Life:** These angry balls come from things like:

>Pollution, Sunlight, Smoking, Even just your body using energy

>So, free radicals are like tiny troublemakers inside you, and antioxidants are like little peacekeepers that calm them down.

Chronically sore & tight since stopping with ZMA,"
I’ve been taking ZMA for 3 months daily to help with recovery from gym workouts. Finished the pack a few weeks ago and thought of trying to see how’s my performance is without it. To my surprise some muscles are now chronically tight, fatigued, and aching. Specifically the hamstrings, forearms, biceps, and shoulders/scapula.

The hamstrings are so sore & tight even 3-5 days after working them. I feel that if I try to stretch them I might even tear them or injure myself.

Psyllium Husk and Urination,"Hi all,

Does anyone else find that fibre supplements make them urinate more often? Originally I thought it was because I was drinking more water when taking psyllium husk but I’m not actually drinking much more water than usual, but I’ve found that I’m weeing about once an hour after taking psyllium husk and my wee is completely clear. I managed to find a couple of other people mentioning the same thing but the links seem very anecdotal right now. I’d be interested to hear if anyone else has noticed this. 

I understand the most common explanation is likely that people increase fluid intake when taking fibre supplements so urinate more often but I’m probably only having 1 cup more of water than normal (max) but weeing 4-5 times more every day and far more frequently. Would be interested to hear any theories! (Perhaps the fibre is somehow also drawing more fluid toward the bladder?)

Help to pick the right supplements,"Hi!   
  
I find myself in a tuff place in life and really want to change things up. I dived deep into the supplements world until the point i got a bit overwhelmed by the options and was hoping some of you could give me some advices.  



To explain my situation I'm 35 years old male. Diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety, Chronic Tension Headache with neck pain, Autoimmune disease Hidradenitis Suppurativa, Back Acne, Binocular Vision Dysfunction and Sinusitis (Still have congestion with mucus in nose and throat despite multiple surgeries in my sinuses.)

Besides that i have discomfort in my gut (Specialist just told me to eat fiber supplement but it doesnt help). I have dry and irritated eyes, Dry skin, Dry mouth, Sore and stiff joints and Feet pain. (Checked for Arthritis in my hands but no arthritis.) I often have cramps in my legs and feet and my temperature regulation is terrible as i almost always feel cold or hot and easily starts sweating a ton. So definently a weak nerve system and a lot of inflamation going on to name a few. Its just getting worse and i need it to change.



For the past years been prescribed Pregabalin 300x 2 daily for Chronic headache, Amitriptyline 50mg x1 at night for Chronic headache, Fluanxol (Flupentixol) 1mg x2 daily for Anxiety and to help control my thoughts, Elvanse 50mg daily for ADHD, Mometasone for chronic sinusitis. I also just been presciped long term antibiotics for my Hidradenitis Suppurativa as it keeps breaking out and i have had a lot of surgeries by now but i really dont want to start antibiotics if i can avoid so and i feel like a least trying with some anti inflamatory supplements would make sense to try aswell. Already had plenty of Antibiotics. 

Before this i was on a terrible path with 20 painkillers a day were Tramadol were one of them for a long period so this is already an improvement. But man there's room for more. Besides the above symptons my mental health is terrible.  

I always feel fatigued, generally have a bad mood, no motivation for anything, dulled emotions, evolved bad temper and easily gets annoyed. I don't really want to be around people, i have no mental clarity and never peace in mind. At the same time i feel kinda depressed i also feel super sensitive and easily gets very emotional and overwhelmed. Often get like stomach ache just thinking about life and i think a lot about death. Despite the medication i don't feel like my ADHD is better and sometimes im in doubt if its ADD and some days i even feel like it made it worse and that im bipolar or have autismn now. I still can't focus and i have 40 pages open with youtube videos because i cant finish them before seeing something else that will caught my eye and i still have restless legs despite my meds. I feel like the doctors don't understand me and im stuck on this medication path with lots of side effects and little outcome and also got a bad weed addiction. Its just bad. 

So i really want to try and go the supplement route instead. I want to get better and make up for all theese antibiotics and painkillers+meds. I looked a lot on youtube and found quite a lot of stuff interesting. I know most of it probably wont do anything for me but i do want to give it a chance. But im kinda lost in all the options and how i should try to implement it and what to prioritise.



**Theese are supplements i have found that COULD potentially do SOMETHING for me and then i add'ed a few bulletpoints that made it interesting to me:**

*Lions Mane (Good for Cognitive function, focus, concentration, memory and can help regenerate the nerve tissue.)*

*NAC (Good for Addictions, OCD, Anxiety, ADHD, Bipolar, Brain health, Anti inflamatory, Normalise neurotransmitters. Can help reduce liver and kidney damage and supports higher Glutathione levels.)*

*Ashwaganda (Powerful adaptogen for Anxiety and Chronic Stress. Good for Mental Clarity, Negative thinkin and help you go through personal problems. Would be 2x 300mg per day with 6 weeks on and 2 weeks off cycles to avoid side effects.)*

*Liquid Chlorophyll (Good for Pain relief, Wound healing, Gut issues, Bad odor, Bad skin, Gives you energy, Is anti inflamatory. Can help reverse grey hair if because of copper or B12 deficiency. Is basically liquid sunshine.)* 



*Alpha Lipoic Acid (Helps Mitochondria with more energy, Powerful Antioxidant that helps other Antioxidants thrive. Good for Nerves, Neuropathy pain like feet pain.)*

*Benfotiamine (Restless legs, Neuropathy pain, Restores Neuro function and Neiropathies.)*

*Berberine (Reverse Mitochondria damage, Protects Mitochondria, Lowers Insulin Resistance, Neuro Protective, Good for Anxiety, Depression and Withdrawal from drugs.)*

*B6 (Deficiency can potentially lead to Nubness in feet and hands, Gut inflamation, IBS, Deficiency of neurotransmitters which can affect the mood)*

*B1 Thiamine (Helps Neurologic issues, Supports nervous system, Neuropathy. Sign of defienciency can be: Excessive sweating, Feeling irritated, Bad regulation of temperature like sweating and feeling cold)*  

*\*Should take B1 with a B Complex*  



*Vitamin D3 & K2 (Can ease signs of depression, Anti inflamatory, Good for Autoimmune Deseases, Good before and after surgeries)*  

*Omega3 Krill or Fishoil (Anti Inflamatory, Good for dermatitis, Dry eyes, Dry skin)* 

*Turmeric (Anti Inflamatory, Powerful Antioxidant, Good for Gut health, Eye health, Sore joints, Autoimmune Deseases, Good for the nervous system)*

*Glucosamin (Anti Inflamatory, Pain relief, Good for Sore joints, Wound healing, Gut inflamation.)*

*CoQ10 (Powerful Antioxidant, Protects the cells, Gives energy, Good for mitochondria, Good for Autoimmune Deseases, Chronic inflamation)* 

*Trace Minerals (Godt for mitochrondria, Can potentially help reverse grey hair if because of defienciency from theese.)* 

*Probiotoic & Prebiotic (Restore Gut Microbiome)*

*Vitamin C (Anti inflamatory Antioxidant, Good for joint pain and Fatigue)*

*Magnesium (Helps relax the muscles, Good for cramps and bad sleep, Nerve support*) 



*I found this ""Nerve support"" supplement with both Benfotiamine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2 and Vitamin D that combines a few of theese.*



And then there's my gut discomfort that havent been resolved with fibers. I think its something with my liver or gallbladder or perhaps because of my bile. Its in that area i have discomfort and it makes sense to me if its my liver reacting on all the painkillers back then and now the meds+bad eating habbits and lifestyle? It did start back then and been going for at least 5 years. Maybe some of theese could help? 

*Galbladder formula with: Choline, 0x Bile, Bile acid, Stoneroot, Slippery Elm*

*Digestive Enzymes with: Betaine Hydrochloride, Apple cider vinegar, Pancreatin power, Pepsin, Ginger root extract, Peppermint leaf extract, Anise seed powder, Fennel seed*

*Liver detox with: Folate, Choline, and proprietary blend from Milk thistsle seed extract, 0x bile extract, Turmeric root extract, SAMe, CoQ10, Black pepper, Astaxanthin*



Im getting my daily steps in and try getting more sunlight. Im starting fitness and i want to start eating Keto perhaps with intermittent fasting as i know theese changes could solve a lot by itself. 

But man its a lot of big changes and not something that happens overnight so i really need all the help i can get. If just a few makes a difference its all worth it. 



But where do you think i would just be wasting my money here and what makes sense to try? 

What would you prioritise and try first? 

Have you been in a similar situation and how did you progress?

Any other  or better suggestions for me? 



I think NAC is probably the one that is the most interesting to as i see some people get some great results with that one. But i honestly think a lot of it makes sense and i obviously wants most of this solved but i also know i found a, lot of stuff lol. I really don't know how to proceed from here so any advices is appreciated!

Does anyone take Tudca?,"I have been on Tudca for about 4 months now. I was diagnosed with fatty liver back in September and have a lot of GI issues.

Looking for Herbal Support for My Dad After Loss,"My mum recently passed away, and while I’ve been coping and sleeping well (as that’s what she would want), my dad is struggling. He says he constantly feels unwell due to lack of sleep, anxiety, and frustration.

I bought Grass & Co Maitake Mushrooms with Ashwagandha + Magnesium, but I’ve only taken them once myself, and he doesn’t seem too interested. He has mentioned CBD, but he’s unsure what would work best for him—he just wants to go to Holland & Barrett and see what’s available.

At the moment, he drinks a sleep tea with spiced apple, vanilla, chamomile, and passionflower, but I think he’s looking for something to help him relax more during the day since grief and stress are really affecting his health.

Heavier Breathing After Taking Ashwagandha,"Hello, I’ve been taking ashwagandha in drops for about two weeks. I wouldn’t call it shortness of breath, but I noticed after a few days that my breathing feels heavier—I pant and breathe more heavily, as if slightly fatigued. Additionally, I constantly feel the urge to take slow, deep breaths.

I’m not sure if this is a side effect or if I’ve convinced myself of it after reading about potential negative effects (as I tend to overthink and imagine symptoms).

Here’s the composition of the supplement: „Active Ingredients per Daily Dose (1ml / 24 drops):              •	Ashwagandha root extract – 142.56 mg                    •	Withanolides: 10 mg                                                    •	Alkaloids: 1.43 mg                                                        •	Withaferin A: 2.85 mg                                                  •	Black pepper fruit extract – 0.53 mg                            •	Piperine: 0.50 mg”

Is there anything universally agreed upon that will help with cravings? (Even if its minimal).,"I'm sure this has been beaten to death on this Subreddit and then-some, but I'm re-visiting this topic again to see if perhaps there's anything that's been overlooked or is new.

Does anyone know of anything that helps at all with cravings?

I have an odd addiction to the chocolate tasing protein bars and snacks. I will eat one as a substitute for regular junk food or a meal, but then find myself craving a second, or a third, or a fourth. One Quest cookie will quickly turn into an entire box, even when I'm not actually hungry.

My brain yanks at my heart strings all day long until I give in and eat one. 

It's both funny and frustrating too because I don't have this issue with things like McDonalds, potato chips, donuts, potatoes or pasta. I generally eat a super low carb diet, but it's the protein bars and protein snacks that I just crave and struggle with. For reference, I lost 106 lbs. back in 2022 doing keto and fasting and have since kept up with many of my keto diet habits, doing low carb and low sugar is generally really easy minus the cravings for Quest bars, and sweet tasting protein snacks.

Is there anything out there that might help calm this down and help my brain chill out with the cravings? Even if the help is minimal anything would be welcome at this point.

I need to get my brain and body un-addicted which is probably at least a 6-week chore.

I took two of the Olly Combat Cravings pills today with my lunch to see if those help or not (***a co-worker of mine had some in her desk and offered to let me try them to see if I like them or not***).

Suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated.

Protein Isolate Powders Without Artificial Sweeteners or Sugar Substitutes,"This is yet another thread about protein powders, but because these threads are a dime-a-dozen I wanted to focus specifically on powders that are protein isolate, taste good, and don't contain any artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes (to me, the ""natural"" substitutes like Stevia or Monk Fruit extract taste just as bad as any other artificial sweetener).

Despite thousands of brands of protein powder, there don't seem to be very many that meet this criteria. Here are three that came close

* Transparent Labs
   * This is my go-to for unflavored whey isolate, but their flavored offerings use stevia extract
* Xwerks
   * Seemed promising, but uses Stevia as well
* Boba Tea Protein
   * Some amazing flavors, but they all use Monk fruit extract to sweeten

As it stands, there aren't many brands that don't use artificial sweeteners, but it seems like there aren't ANY brands that offer flavored powders without any kind of sugar substitute. Any of the three I listed would be great if it weren't for the stevia or monk fruit extracts.

If I continue doing D3 w/ K2 without mag, what are the possible effects (and please provide scientific references if possible).

I then stopped the D3 and K2 for 2 weeks and retested and my D level dropped to a 55, so I would interpret that as meaning that my body is properly using the D stores up as needed (even without magnesium).

Since last October-ish, I have struggled to digest protein shakes. These are some things I have noticed:

* It happens with plant and animal based proteins
* There’s less discomfort when I have the shake with milk (full cream, almond, skim, anything) instead of water
* There is less discomfort if I have it on a full stomach
* I don’t experience this discomfort when having meats or protein bars.
* It’s worst with [Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard 100% Whey Powder (Extreme Milk Chocolate flavour)](https://www.optimumnutrition.com/en-au/Products/Protein-Powders/Gold-Standard-100%25-Whey-Powder/p/gold-standard-100-whey-protein).

Plant Protein (Berry)](https://incsports.com.au/products/inc-plant-protein-berry/)

Other info

* Symptoms are just general unease in the stomach, mild nausea (if particularly bad), gassiness (sometimes).
* I had a h. pylori infection last year but treated it with antibiotics and PPIs last Aug - Sep. This inability to digest protein shakes has mostly occurred after that but did occasionally happen before as well when consuming the Optimum Nutrition Gold Whey.
* I don’t have the best gut health and am actively working to improve that through diet and probiotics. I can now digest most things except caffeine and protein shakes.
* I can't figure out whether it's a reaction to protein, or something else in shakes.

I have spoken to a GP and a nutritionist, neither of whom have been able to isolate the cause of the problem, or suggest a solution so I’m turning to Reddit for help.

Question about Creatine Bloating and Loading vs Maintanence,"Hi, so I am getting back to the gym, however previously have not used supplements so was looking for help.

As I have been working a 9-5 for the first time since stopping my workouts I have found my gym perfomance poor in energy levels, I also struggle to get the protein I need due to living in a vegetarian household (religious reasons - not on my end, just respecting them) so I am def investing in protein powder.

I am however confused about creatine, as everyone says its the one supplement worth investing in.

However, I keep hearing complaints about looking bloated in the face?

I don't really care if my body looks puffy, but what degree of face bloat are we talking here as I have not seen before and afters and am confused if this is reported from people who were initially lean thus can tell the difference more. 

Due to studies and general health, I've gained pounds so my face kinda has puff to it anyways.

Are there ways to stop this from happening? I heard people mention these side effects can be due to not drinking enough water but I drink like 3.8L a day.

Another thing is I have IBS, I've seen reports on it helping with IBD with things like ulceritive colitis, however IBS is different. I have however seen stomach discomfort reported for the ""loading"" phase vs just doing 5 grams, so would drinking enough water and just doing a maintanence phase to start be alright with me?

I mean creatine does not respond in 25% of people, so I should probrably give it a go anyways and just see how I respond.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ji7epz/question_about_creatine_bloating_and_loading_vs/,1742757961.0

Valerian Root to try to combat sleeping pill addiction,"Hey guys, 

Little background: I've had insomnia since I was 19 (35 now). After a few years of talking to my psych about it, he prescribed me zolpidem. One zolpidem would have me asleep in 15-20 minutes, it was great. I then started to grow a tolerance for it. It now takes at least 5 zolpidem to even get me off to sleep, and I'm still waking during the night, and I'll take a couple more. 

I really want to try to combat this; it's ruining my mind, and I've been researching herbal supplements to try instead. Valerian root seems to be the one people find most helpful.   
I don't know what dose I would need to take as I'm so used to the zolpidem.   
For ref: I'm female, 55/56kg, and have a high tolerance for most things. 

Can anyone give their experience with it?   
  
I've seen 500mg, 2400mg, 4000mg, and 5000mg (which seems a little excessive), but I don't know where to start. 

If I start at 500mg and it doesn't work, I'll probably be fuming.

Vit D,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with a health issue and hope that someone here can help me figure things out.

For quite some time, I’ve been struggling with libido issues and occasional erectile dysfunction, especially during phases when my libido was low. During these times, I also suffered from acne and depression. Things got significantly worse between December and April, but in the summer, the bad phases became shorter.

I’m originally from Syria and have been living in Germany for 10 years. In 2022, I had a severe thigh fracture, and just four months after the accident, I got COVID-19. That’s when everything started going downhill, and managing my symptoms became increasingly difficult.

A dude recommended that I take vitamin D. I didn’t test my levels beforehand and started taking the following daily doses:
	•	7500 IU Vitamin D
	•	200 mcg Vitamin K
	•	400 mg Magnesium citrate
	•	15 mg Zinc bisglycinate

I followed this protocol for two months. At first, I felt better for a short while, but then my symptoms worsened again—although not as badly as before. This scared me because I thought I might have overdone it with the vitamin D dosage.

So, I finally got my vitamin D levels tested and was surprised to find that I was still deficient, with a result of 20.4 ng/ml. The funny thing is, my doctor told me to take 20,000 IU per week, and when I mentioned that I was already taking 7,500 IU per day, he had nothing more to say.

Now I’m unsure what to do and where I might have gone wrong. Has anyone experienced something similar, or does anyone have advice?

Myoinositol- caused excessive sweating and hyper state (and minimal glucose reduction),"Guy here,….I tried this specifically to lower my glucose from pre-diabetes into the normal ranges. Very few people at the pre-diabetes sub have used this, so I came here.

This is such an odd supplement with information spread throughout Reddit - a little in many places.

First, I tried regular natal 500 mg , then twice, then three times a day for about a month, hoping to reduce glucose. It didn’t do much. 

500 mg a day doesn’t really do much but might possibly help me sleep and it induced dreams.

Anything over 500 mg a day makes me have a sweaty and warm energy episode about a half hour later. And insomnia that night.

So then I tried myoinositol powder, hoping that would decrease glucose more if I could tolerate it. Unfortunately, it had the same hot sweaty , insomnia results.

I thought of trying to take this longer, but this just doesn’t seem healthy to do .

Thoughts on current stack,"Hoping to get the community’s thoughts on my current stack. A little background on myself, I’m a 30/M who is very active, sleeps about 6-7 hours a night and WFH. 

Maybe someone could share their thoughts and keep me honest, but I feel like some of these may be overkill now. Starting from the beginning:

1. L-Arginine first thing in the morning 
- Mainly for exercise performance and blood condition (beta-thalassemia). 

2.  Multivitamin
- General all encompassing vitamins and minerals. 

3. Tongkat-Ali 
- Had experienced levels of low-T for a while. Currently on testosterone injections, but this did help bump up the numbers. 

4. St. John’s Wort. 
- When I first started taking this, I noticed a drastic change in my overall mood. Hopefully not some sort of placebo. 

Super Omega-3:
- Heart disease runs in my family. 

Iron-C:
- Vitamin C combined with iron. My anemia tends to knock me on my butt when I push my workouts too hard. This think helps keep my immune system in check. 

D3:
- Growing up in FL, sunlight was never an issue, but my bloodwork said otherwise in terms of my D levels. Having moved to SC since then, I can only imagine what they’d look like if I didn’t take it. 

Glutamine:
- Muscle recovery 

B-12 Folate:
- Bloodwork showed a Vitamin B deficiency. 

Zinc: 
- Helps me fall asleep taken 30 min before bed. 

Beef Organs:
- This one is new, but I’ve noticed that I have had much more energy throughout the day. The jury is still out on whether there’s any legitimacy to this, or again a placebo.

How to cycle ashwaganda,"Im not the best at explaining things, but I'll try my best.

I have always had bad anxiety, but I never opted to do any sort of anxiety management. Recently, I have started to have bad intrusive thoughts that have interrupted my ability to sleep or live a daily life. Im not sure about the actual dosage, but I have been taking extra strength ashwaganda once almost every day for about 3-4 months because of my intrusive thoughts. Of course I still had intrusive thoughts, but it was far less severe and caused manageable anxiety at worst. However, recently ashwaganda has pretty much completely stopped working, and I'm back to how I was before taking it. After doing some research I learned that ashwaganda should be taken in cycles, because you can build a tolerance to it. But there is not a clear answer or any details on how to cycle it and the exact effects, so I have a few questions regarding that.

When it comes to how long a period you should cycle it, the answers are all over the place. Some people say you should take it for about 1-2 months than take a 2-3 week break, and other people say you should take it for 3 months than take a 3 month break. I hear it's different for everyone, but I'm curious what the ratio is more commonly so that I can get a general picture, since the answers I see are so wildly different.

Another question I have is about the break period. As I said my anxiety is so bad that it ruins my ability to live a daily life or sleep, so I am worried about the effects you will feel in the break period. Is it okay to switch between two different supplements? I was considering switching between ashwaganda and magnesium- although I've never taken magnesium and don't know much about it. If so, I was wondering what the differences between the two supplements are, and if there are any long term effects to alternating. If not, what is the effects and feeling people get in the break period? Does your anxiety levels go back to normal in the break period? And if it does, are there any good anxiety management methods? Cause as I said, my anxiety is so bad it ruins my ability to live a daily life.

Sorry for the long post, I just have a lot of questions and concerns I'm having a hard time getting and answer to. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jhs5o0/how_to_cycle_ashwaganda/,1742707523.0

Cold pressed castor oil and trace amounts of ricin,"I got some cold pressed castor oil to try.  Everything I had read said there was no ricin present in castor oil;  that it was removed during processing, even for cold pressed.

However, doing some more checking, I found this:

https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=311037

""Our results indicate that only the cold-pressed castor oil contained measurable levels of the toxin, estimated to be 35 'g/l ± 13 'g/l. A standard oral dose of castor oil for laxative use is 14 ml, so even cold-pressed castor oil would be well below the toxic level. However, the presence of the toxin indicates that other soluble proteins, including allergens, are likely to be present in cold-pressed castor oil.""

So it seems cold pressed castor oil may contain trace amounts of ricin.  Even though it's below the toxic level for normal doses, I'm thinking I don't like the idea of ingesting any amount of ricin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jhpw9p/cold_pressed_castor_oil_and_trace_amounts_of_ricin/,1742699279.0
Anyone Try L-Theanine with Coffee for Anxiety and Jitters?,"I’ve been thinking about ways to improve my coffee experience since, even though I enjoy coffee and the caffeine boost, it’s been making me feel like crap.

But then I realized I could just take l-theanine with my coffee instead—and it’d be much cheaper than making the switch.

"RO Water, Peeing a lot, will adding trace minerals (something like Concentrace) help with this?","I've been drinking RO water for a bit, i notice it just goes right through me and I have to pee so much, its terrible.  I talked with someone on a plane recently and he was saying that this happens with RO.  When i google this, it says:

  
""RO (reverse osmosis) water, being highly purified and lacking minerals, can lead to increased urination because it's hypotonic (less concentrated) and draws more water from the body, leading to a higher volume of urine produced to maintain electrolyte balance""

  
So I'm wondering if adding trace mineral drops, something like Concentrace from Trace Minerals (brand that I have), will resolve this issue or if I should just get off RO water/trace mineral drops completely.  And go back to tap water, or buy spring water (i'd rather not).

EGCG capsules vs liquid extract - notice any difference?

Sometimes the onset is within a couple hours, sometimes it doesn’t happen till 12 hours later. It doesn’t go away if I don’t take ibuprofen. 

I tried skipping a couple days and the headaches immediately subsided. I’d stop taking it altogether except that it really helped me with what I needed (fixing my lack of sensitivity during sex, plus helping with histamine issues. These are major issues that impact my quality of life but so are headaches!)

Has anyone who experiences this side effect had any luck with switching to a liquid extract instead. Did that help?

Magnesium Glycinate and insomnia.,"Hey everyone, recently tried magnesium glycinate before bed, but oddly it gave me insomnia (despite its rep for calming effects!). 


Going to test taking it in the morning instead to see if timing fixes the issue. If insomnia persists, my next step is pairing it with vitamin B1 (thiamine), since I’ve read B1 supports magnesium metabolism and might balance its effects.


Sharing this in case others have similar experiences—ever dealt with magnesium *causing* sleep issues? Or tried combining it with B1? Will update with results, but curious for any tips or science-backed insights!

Male, mid 20s, Keto.

MG Glycinate makes me feel great, just once I wake up in early morning, I can not fall asleep anymore.

Very complicated situation with glutamate/gaba,"Short story, I have natural onset anhedonia from prolonged stress, panic attacks. Later I took gabapentin pill for sleep and anxiety and get acute paradoxical reaction. Something went wrong and my anhedonia become worse, temporary get neuropathy symptoms, constant inner tension, disrupted sleep. 

Only thing which helping me now is Klonopin with L-Theanine. But I need to get out from Klonopin, because I know how it can ended.
So I believe my main problem now, glutamate. Dopamine probably also too, but It separate task. I’m trying to return my baseline before crash.

Which supplements stack can help reduce glutamate issues, reset GABA receptors.
Also I’m talking Lamictal 150mg per day, not helping at all. So lowering glutamate itself not a solution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jgs1z8/very_complicated_situation_with_glutamategaba/,1742592462.0
My experience 1.5 weeks on NAC,"1200-1800mg daily.   
  
Diagnosed bipolar years ago, stayed unmedicated.   
Had no anticipation or knowledge of this, but it appears that NAC has successfully reduced my bipolar disorder to nil.   
Seriously. I'm not in complete hell anymore.    
My vision is clear, my peripheral vision is full, where before my vision was distorting a lot.    
    
I had very dry eyes, contact lenses wearer.   
I'm also on finasteride, which some people say dries the eyes.   
NAC seems to correct this. My eyes are way more tolerable in general.   
My sinuses are completely clear.   
I can breathe better than I can remember in a long, long time.   
   
Chest tightness is gone. Lungs feel better. Breathing feels better. I'm sleeping better.   
All of this past year, when I go to sleep, sinuses clog. Can't breathe through nose well.   
Wake up feeling like I have a hole in my head and a void in my chest; ultimate depression and suicidal ideology.   
    
Last night laying in bed, I had an epiphany.   
I can fucking breathe, and I can breathe so good.   
I slept better than I think I have in a long ass time last night.   
Everything felt better. My positioning.   
Like, I slept like an actual human last night.   
Most of the night I slept on my back.   
I never really do that. I sleep on my side, but it ""felt right"" and good to do this with NAC in my system.   
I slept the entire night.   
I woke up exactly 1 minute before my alarm.   
Odd.   
But I woke up feeling so well rested, alert. Immediately tuned in.   
I realized, the hole in my head feeling was gone. The immense depression and suicidal ideology was gone.   
   
I feel better throughout the day with this stuff in my system.   
It seems impossible to seethe into oblivion like I usually would, being bipolar.   
    
   
I'm 28.  
I started smoking cigs, vaping, smoking weed about 15 years ago. Really consistently for about 12 years.   
I've always been very resilient, I quit smoking cigs like 5 years ago but I still vape nic and I vape cannabis.    
Never been a drinker.   
Don't drink coffee.   
Barely drink sodas.    
No prescriptions, pretty square over here.   
   
Last year, got covid twice, lost sense of smell and taste for 9 months.    
I corrected it with vitamins, tea tree oil and some NAC but I didn't actually know what NAC was doing (buddy gave it to me), so probably never took enough of it.   
    
   
Not gonna lie. I just saw it in my cupboard, remembered ""it's a nootropic"", and just started taking it randomly again last week.   
I read up little by little each day as I kept taking it (this is dumb I know but my God it was the gift that kept giving in this situation), I knew it wasn't gonna be horrible.    
My NAC is the same company that makes my vitamins and I liked them a lot so I said screw it, started taking it.   
The company is Life Extension.   
    
   
I just wanna say, this shit right here.   
This shit is a fucking miracle for somebody like me.   
   
I had the solution to some of my biggest problems right in my cabinet for the whole last year man.   
     
    
This shit is amazing and it's also inducing cessation of nicotine and cannabis use, because it appears that having NAC in my system negates the potency of both. Not entirely. But my cravings are lowering by the day.    
    
    
I'm not out of the woods yet.   
The biggest thing for me is bipolar.   
That shit has been ruining my life.   
SSRI's just knocked me out every time. Couldn't ever do those.  
This shit is fucking perfect, I feel like I've been aging backwards.

Overwhelmed but desperate for help!,"If you're reading this, I would like to say thank you first. I have been wanting to better my health for some time now. I have a few medical issues and want to be around for as long as I can. I am 28f and have four kids. I was in the Army for 9 years and then diagnosed with medical stuff that resulted in a medical discharge. I want to start taking vitamins and supplements. I spoke to my doctors, and they said just to let them know if I start taking anything.

I have found great resources here about vitamins, supplements, etc. I am relatively active. I am at the gym for 2 or 3 hours a day, 6 days a week. Other than that, I am relatively sedimentary. I get at least 6,000 steps in on my slow days. I am overweight, 228 lbs, and 5'8"". I am about to stop breastfeeding as well, which means I'm ready for supplements.

My overall goal is to lose weight now, which I have been doing as I've lost 15 pounds since December. It's slow, but we are getting there.

So this is where my question is: Where do I begin with everything? I am leaning towards NOW, but what specifically should one take?

I'm taking vitamin D, Iron, B12, and Zinc now, but it's the Spring Valley from Walmart, and from what I'm seeing, it's not the best quality.

Should I add other stuff like ashwagandha, beta-alanine, BCAAs, etc.? It's honestly really overwhelming on their website. There is SO much that I don't know what I need or what is with it. Is there a more straightforward website or a better place to start my journey? I see that Thorne has a few tests you can purchase. Are those worth it? What about Naked? My husband uses their bacaas. Are there any good bundles or packs/stacks to try out? I have been looking a lot, and again, I'm just overwhelmed with the many products out there. I have even asked Copilot and Gemini to help make sense of them, but I am stuck on my next steps and purchases.

I am also looking for creatine, a pre-workout or post-workout. I have been upping my protein and know the trick about adding a zero to the back. If it doesn't exceed the calories, it's not a great source of protein. I am using ISO 100 and Thorne Creatine, as well as Optimum Nutrition Amino Energy from Walmart.

Any insight or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Alternative to turmeric?,"Hello,

I've suffered from postprandial dyspepsia for years. I've seen doctors who haven't found a solution to this problem, other than to ""deal with it"" (yup...).

So I searched around and finally found a solution: turmeric. More specifically, the supplement from AromaZone (a french brand). And miraculously, I was finally able to eat like everyone else!

The problem: a course of treatment has to last a month, otherwise you risk becoming accustomed to it. This was my case: I stopped after 30 days, but the symptoms returned during my first meal. So I started again, but the effects were less effective.

So I'm looking for an alternative to take during ""at least"" my 15-day break.

Would any of these things have caused a worsening of my symptoms in the past week or so?,"I have a long-term condition along the likes of long covid, but over the past few days I have had a few symptoms become much more bothering than they were previously. In particular- feeling hot on the inside of my body regardless of outside temp (worse last few weeks but especially last few days), increased mucus in throat and difficulty getting a full breath, chest feels tight especially when exercising, strain much worse on my back between shoulders, and a really muzzy/lightheaded/uncomfortable feeling in my head.

As far as I remember the things that have changed over the past few weeks are:

\-          Started lisdexamfetamine because I was recently diagnosed with ADHD (since 11th Feb)

\-          Stopped taking paroxetine (antidepressant) around 3^(rd) February which had its own withdrawal symptoms which were bad for a couple weeks but feels weird that additional symptoms would appear now.

\-          Started taking gingko biloba around the same time in early February and nan bao a few weeks before as recommended by my chinese medicine doctor.

\-          Started taking creatine some time last month

\-          Switched from Omega 3 to Omega 3 + CoQ10 a couple weeks ago

\-          I have also been trying EAT self-treatment last few weeks aswell

"MSM and anxiety, help needed.","Hello dear people from this subreddit. 

Recently I got hit by a big storm of anxiety,
sickening feeling(mentally) and even some panic bouts, especially about the future and plans for it. 

The most likely culprit is MSM since I have started taking it about a month ago. 

Does anybody mind reaching out who has a good knowledge concerning this. 

Physically I have never felt better, and I know that it was because of the MSM, the energy spike is unbelievable and I feel like a few years younger 
and fitter. 

But mentally it has gotten worse, especially in regards of overthinking and thinking of the future and future plans. 

It seems like the MSM amplified the things that I was already feeling by 10x. 

Could it be also because of the following things; 

1. I have so much energy that I don’t use, like gym or being productive and active. Can this have caused the undesirable effects, and maybe I just need to use the energy?


2. Could it be that the body is getting rid of toxins and inflammation and this is a byproduct of that? In that case is it possible that I need to push through? 

I would grateful to any advice and experience that anybody wants and can share. 

If somebody wants to reach out in private chat,
that is also fine.

"Magnesium makes my ectopic heartbeats, sleep and mood worse?","I've been having daily PVC's / PAC's and the occasional run of them since I've had COVID. I've have long suspected the main reason for my pvc's to be electrolyte imbalances. I recently did a blood test but still waiting on the results.

I've treid many things to get them under control. Sometimes I do stuff which seems to work, but other times I don't know anymore.

A while ago I tried taking the 'full dose' of magnesium per day according to the label at least. That's 3 pills per day which would add up to around 300-350 mg of essential magnesium.

I tried a combination of 2x taurate and 1x malate. At first it seemed to get better. I got way fewer PVC's per day and I started to feel better. I thought I cracked it.  
After around 10 days of this, I started feeling restless in my stomach. An uneasy nervous feeling that I coulnd't shake. Slept very poorly because of it. After a few days I got a short run of SVT again and more ectopics.

I lowered my dose of magnesium again, and the SVT didn't return but the pvc's and pac's kept going. So I figured that maybe it was the taurate, not the magnesium. Last 2 days I have been upping my dose of magnesium again to 3 pills but this time malate only.

Last night, again extremely restless. Nervous feeling in my stomach. Way more pvc's again.

So tl;dr

If I stay well under the RDA of magnesium, it doesn't really help but also I don't feel side effects. If I take the full dose (300-350 mg per day divided over 3 tablets once per day), I get a nervous, restless feeling and increased pvc's.

I've also tried mag glycinate in the past but it also messes with my sleep, even in lower amounts. I guess I just can't really handle magnesium.

Why would that be the case? Could it interfere with other electrolytes? Is it possible that I have 'enough' already and am kind of 'overdosing', even though the total amount isn't so high?

"Hello, I have a question regarding the safety of these supplements","Kava, L-Theaine, Melatonin, Magnesium Glycinate, Vitamin C . 

I took these in order to sleep at 6PM and felt fine up until 11PM . Heart started racing, body temperature was hot, ears ringing, dizziness . 

Important to know I used 40mgs of Adderall at 6AM that morning which is a very normal dose for me . Then at 5PM , 11 hours later I felt the comedown so I took those supplements at 6PM . After I took them I felt very physically relaxed and tired which was what I was hoping for . But for some reason at 11PM something happened. 

The symptoms I listed in my the first paragraph went away because I took 0.5 Xanax in order to sleep . It’s now 5AM and I want to sleep until 8AM, I took some melatonin but it’s not kicking in and I really need some sleep. I’ll take another 0.25 of xanax. 

My questions are has anyone else ever experienced these bad symptoms from those supplements? And no it’s not the Adderall because it was 13 hours later that I took the supplements and also I took Vitamin C to flush it out . 

And then also, I was and still am aware of the xanax hangover but I needed to sleep.

"5 weeks on Creatine – Amazing performance, but bloated and gaining weight! Help?","Hi everyone,

I've been taking creatine monohydrate consistently for exactly 5 weeks now. 5g a day without a loading phase. Of all the supplements I've tried (and I've tried quite a few!), creatine is the first one where I genuinely feel a noticeable difference. I play racket sports very intensely and run regularly, and since starting creatine, my endurance has improved dramatically, and even better my recovery feels amazing.

But... there's always a but...

I'm naturally well-built but already on the heavier side. In these 5 weeks, my weight has been fluctuating quite noticeably—going up and down by as much as 3.5 kg (about 7-8 lbs)—and I feel bloated with a visible ""beer belly"" look.

I really don't want to stop taking creatine because of how beneficial it's been for my workouts, but the bloating and weight gain really bother me.

I am sure I am not the first one to feel like this... Will it go away on its own? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

"advice on intermittent tics, brain fog, and speech difficulties","Hey everyone, I’m looking for some insights or advice about a condition I’ve been dealing with for years now. I’m in my 20s, and since I was about 14, I’ve been experiencing a set of recurring issues that are really affecting my daily life. The symptoms seem to come in cycles, usually lasting for about two weeks every two months or so. Here’s what I’m dealing with:
	•	Tics: I experience eye tics (twitching), neck spasms, forearm movement, and even my ears move involuntarily at times. These tics are random and can be triggered or worsen during these episodes.
	•	Speech Problems: During these episodes, I struggle with speech. I stutter, have difficulty finding words, and sometimes can’t think of the words I want to say. It feels like my brain just can’t keep up with my speech, and I get really frustrated because I can’t express myself clearly.
	•	Fatigue and Weakness: Alongside these issues, I feel incredibly tired and weak during these periods. It’s hard to function normally because of the mental and physical exhaustion.
	•	Cyclic Nature: These episodes seem to come every couple of months, and they last around two weeks. Outside of these cycles, I feel fine, though I’m always aware of the tics, which have been present for years.
	•	No Major Life Changes: There hasn’t been any specific event that triggered this condition; it just started out of nowhere when I was 14. I’ve had blood tests done, and everything has come back normal.

How do I boost my libido while on birth control?,"Are there any supplements, vitamins or creams I can use to boost my libido?

Before I stopped in November 2024, I had been taking the hormonal pill. I was on Rubidelle from March 2022 to April 2023, on Drovelis from April 2023 to November 2024; both completely killed my sex drive. I talked about the problem with my Obgyn and she suggested stopping with the hormonal pill to get a non-hormonal IUD.

I stopped taking the pill on November 18th; as my obgyn predicted my libido was fully back in the span of 3 days.

I was scheduled to get my IUD on February 4th, but it was impossible to proceed. My gynocologist tried for more than 1 hour to insert it, but my uterus is too small, even if she used the smallest non-hormonal IUD available in my country.

As a last-ditch effort, my obgyn prescribed Nuvaring, an hormonal birth control vaginal ring. On March 5th I started using it, and here we are yet again. My libido is back to absolute 0. I have a follow up appointment scheduled in June, but that is too far away. I need a solution for my non-existent libido (even if temporary) RIGHT NOW.

I unfortunately MUST use birth control as my family is extremely fertile. I want to have children in the future, so tying my tubes is not an option.

TLDR: even after several attempts, hormonal birth control has reduced my libido significantly. Are there any supplements, vitamins or creams I can use to boost it? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jfmvra/how_do_i_boost_my_libido_while_on_birth_control/,1742470789.0

Intravenous Glutathione,"Hello, I’m making this post to improve its visibility on Google using SEO. Do not inject glutathione lyophilized powder from vials manufactured in other country directly into your veins that you purchase off the internet. That’s all. Thanks!

Specifically: Aqua Skin Glutathione

Places that sell stuff like this are notorious for producing it as cheaply as possible, with no oversight or accountability, if it's even real. Their claims are typically lies, such as being manufactured to certain standards or in a specific country. If you get hurt by one of these products, you have **no recourse** unless the country you're in has a treaty with the country you manage to trace it back to, IF you manage to track them down.

For example, the brand I mentioned above claims to be made in Switzerland. A quick NSLookup reveals that their domain is hosted in the Philippines. Searching Swiss government business records produces no results, and the address they claim to use leads back to an apartment complex. 

The body has mechanisms to handle foreign matter or contaminants when administered subcutaneously, but not intravenously. You are playing Russian roulette if you inject it. This also applies to health and wellness clinics that sell injections or IV drips. Unless they can provide a verifiable chain of custody for the substances they offer, you are gambling with your well being. At least then, if you get hurt you can sue them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jffmeu/intravenous_glutathione/,1742440484.0

Magnesium can promote restful sleep, but some people supplement glycine by itself for sleep. The dose is typically several grams.

Weirdly she manages to play a lot of hockey and go to the gym and stay out late and have a massive social life and do all her work without any visible ill effects but frankly I think she’s a ticking time bomb!

I recently lost over 140 lbs with dieting and going to the gym (Went from 448 lbs to 303). Recently, I've been doing heavier and more intense strength training. I currently take a pre-workout with some creatine before the gym, and I make a protein shake with Grass Fed Naked Whey (I add a scoop of frozen berries and a banana to the shake) post-workout. I've been hearing a lot of people also taking intra-workout during their workout. Right now, I feel like my workouts are going okay, but I do feel myself slowing down as the time goes on. I do push myself through, and get through it. I typically have time to do about an hour and 15 minutes of strength training (different muscle groups each day), and then do 30 minutes of cardio. Only day I don't have enough time for cardio is Mondays as the gym opens later and I have to be at work for a certain time, so I only have time to work legs out for an hour and 15 minutes.

I'm wondering if adding in an intra-workout would help or not. I've been looking at ANS Performance Quench EAA, but noticed a lot of the Amino Acids in Quench are the same that are in the Naked Whey protein powder I take post-workout. Would there be any benefit?

HMTA Hair Mineral Analysis / Mineral Balancing Results - Any advice?,"Hi folks,   
  
I've had these results and I'm wondering it anyone can comment on them? It came with some recommended supplements but a lot of them are in multivitamins etc that I'm already taking (multivitamin is not much different although I take one a day like a normal person and the recommendation is for SIX a day of their own brand - surely that is way too much?!?!). Plus it says to take extra magnesium malate which I started recently, and zinc and pantothenic acid that I already take. So those crossovers have me doubting the value of the test and recommendation if it's stuff I'm already on. 

My sodium and potassium are low yet I drink salt water all day for POTS (about 6g a day of himalayan salt on top of liberal salting of food, and about 700mg potassium chloride mixed in with this). Again this has me doubting it a bit. 

  
It does however want me on adrenal and thyroid glandulars which I'm not sure how I feel about, and GB-3 which looks interesting. I would welcome any insights!

Low dose DHEA concerns,"33M

I have some issues with depression/anxiety, low libido, premature ejaculation, social withdrawal, difficulty maintaining muscle and losing fat, etc. I'm not totally sure if it's hormone related. I do have methylation issues.

Even so, I might want to tilt my hormones in my favor. If I go this course I'd want to be ***very*** cautious as to not downregulate my body's natural production or cause unwanted sides.

I'm thinking a low dose every other day, or maybe with 2 days in between. Like 3-5mg DHEA. Maybe like 5mg pregnenalone along with it to help influence it more to an androgenic path.

I want to avoid hairloss concerns, as it's already thinned a bit in the last few years. I know that what I'm proposing would only potentially have a very subtle effect, but I'm not looming for anything dramatic. If I notice any improvement, even slight, it might give me some insight into what my body needs.

I'm here looking for some input on what I'm proposing from someone with more knowledge and experience on these sorts of things. What might I expect? What would you change? Could this be taken only on mornings of days that I want a small uptick in confidence and libido?

I appreciate any feedback.

Stopping magnesium supplement before a RBC + serum blood test?,"I suffer from heart palpitations (skipped heartbeats) since a COVID infection and I want to get to the bottom of it. So I ordered a mineral / electrolyte bloodtest which includes magnesium serum + magnesium RBC.

I'm taking around 1 tablet per day (115 mg of elemental magnesium from a 1g Mag Malate supplement) per day for a year now. I have also upped the dose here and there to see if it would make a difference, but about 1 tablet per day is average.

I took one in the morning today also. The blood test is tomorrow morning.

Should I actually have stopped taking the supplements for the blood test to be accurate? Or does this work either way, since I am now testing if I am deficient in magnesium even though I am supplementing?

What is your take on this? Also, will these 2 tests tell me anything or is it all completely useless?  
I am also getting tested for potassium, sodium, iron, ferrtine and calcium by the way. But I don't take any other supplements than magnesium.

People who effectively used Butea Superba (Red Kwao Krua),"Hi all,

I've read about Butea Superba to support male libido. According to some reddit posts it could increase DHT and some people suggest that this could lead to hair loss. The few posts I've seen from people using it say that they didn't experience that at all. 

I've asked ChatGPT to search for Thai anecdotal information about it and it couldn't find posts about hair loss. It rather said that the increase of DHT is not proven and that it rather acts as a PDE-5-inhibitor (like a weak Viagra/Cialis) thus increasing bloodflow to the private parts. 

I'm 45 and I don't have any signs of male baldness pattern (yet...), so I'm asking this to people who've really used it for longer periods of time.

2g citrulline-malate

1600mg NAC  
500mg vit-c  
25mg zinc  
100ug selenium  
10mg Propranolol (prescribed)

  
The stack works as intended: anxiety has noticeably decreased, mood is more stable, sleep is a little better, focus and energy during the day are OK

Body temperature is healthy, around 36 degrees celsius. But I FEEL cold. I'm also of normal weight with normal body fat, so it shouldn't be a metabolic issue?  

I tried ashwagandha at some point but it made coldness unbearable so had to stop it. I also have tested with 150ug iodine but it doesn't have much effect.

Finding the right supplements,"Hello!

I'm just starting to get into supplements and it's just so overwhelming. There's easy stuff like isolated vitamins but when it comes to Omega 3 for example, there's just so much stuff to look out for. 

Is there any independent site for testing quality? I find so many different ""top 5"" and while reading the article you can always see some kind of bias and of course, there is THE one supplement that's the best and really far ahead of all the others and the only negative point on the pro/contra list is ""often sold out due to high demand"". So I would really appreciate help in finding something that's unbiased. 

I'm specifically looking for Omega 3 and D3/K2 supplements. If there are no independent tests I would appreciate if you could share your supplements and experiences with them.

Flaky skin on legs,"Okay this might be long but I really need help. I moved to a new city about two weeks ago. The first week I got here I started taking vitamin B and omega 3 supplements. The second week I got MAJORLY sick with the flu so I stopped taking the supplements (just because I could not be bothered to get out of bed and grab them). 

I have always had really smooth soft skin. I’m very very very on top of moisturizing. I use baby oil and body lotion every time I shower. 

This week (now that I’m getting better) I noticed the skin on my legs is flaking. Like it looks like dandruff falling off my legs but sooo excessively. I thought maybe I hadn’t exfoliated enough so I did that but no change. I thought I wasn’t moisturizing enough so I slugged my legs with Vaseline jelly, still didn’t work. It’ll look smooth and good for the time being but the next morning I wake up with the same flaky skin. 

I’ve been researching and some people have said that using vitamin b and then stopping all of a sudden caused this, others have said use of it all together cause this or some are saying omega 3 caused it. I’m also wondering if it was just because I was sick? Did the sickness cause it? How sometimes your body has weird reactions to being sick/can’t cope. 

It’s all very confusing because of the move- there are a variety of different things that have changed which could be causing it but idk why I’m leaning toward the vitamins.

Any advice? Anyone have similar experiences? I am panicking

Is anyone else getting higher blood pressure with creatine?,"Update-I woke up feeling terrible on day 11 so I have decided my body isn't made for creatine.  I will leave this post up for those in the future who have similar problems. My only advise is monitor your blood pressure on creatine and drink your water. 


I am in my mid 40s and a healthy male 6 foot 195 pounds and I weight lift 5 to 6 times a week. My blood pressure is always normal as I regular check it since I have a machine at home to do so. 10 days ago I started a 5g Creatine Monohydrate dose daily with no loading phase and since day three I have noticed a blood pressure spike. Since I am on creatine my blood pressure is 140/150 over 70/80. Interesting that the bottom number hasn't budged but the top certainly has.


Yes I have been drinking plenty of water and taking this with juice and food in the morning. I know from monitoring my parents edema that water retention does increase blood pressure and there is water retention with creatine. The literature isn't very helpful on this and I think most of the younger people that take creatine don't seem to notice or have this issue.

What supplements would you suggest?

A little bit of history- I had blood tests a few months ago which showed low iron and b12. I’ve been supplementing with iron and methylated B complex (Thorne Basic B). I take Thorne magnesium citramag.

When I’m stressed / busy I don’t have time or mental energy to prepare balanced meals so I end up eating quick carb heavy meals (not good - I know)

I’ve been taking ashwaghanda for 3 weeks and it has definitely reduced my stress. 

I have ADHD and take methylphenidate daily.

Here are some things I am considering buying:
-Nordic naturals ultimate omega 2x
-Thorne 2x a day (or life extension because it’s cheaper)
-L Theanine (although I drink matcha lattes daily so perhaps it’s not needed)

"Thoughts on “paradoxical responses” for necessary nutrients? Like B vitamins, Mg, etc.","Basically title——

When someone has a negative reaction to a nutrient that is essential, like a b complex or magnesium (not in superdoses!!), is it suggestive that they especially need it? 

I’ve seen that argument from a lot of functional medicine practitioners. The idea that if you’re having an issue with something necessary then it’s because you’re deficient and your body is freaking out at its presence and just power through with microdoses until things improve and it will all be better on the other side.

How much vitamin D should I take?,"Hello, I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism (an autoimmune disease). I suffered from vitamin D deficiency for quite some time, but my doctor never mentioned it or gave me any supplements. When I started going to a new endocrinologist to treat the fatigue caused by hypothyroidism, seeing that I had 21 ng/ml of vitamin D, she prescribed 0.266 mg of vitamin D in macrodoses. I started in December and so far I've taken this supplement 6 times. Now I told my endocrinologist that I wanted to take vitamin D daily and to be regular, and she told me to choose any supplement I wanted, but only 400-800 IU a day which is the range for any adult, because more could be dangerous. I've been doing some research, and if I'm not mistaken, it's true that toxicity can occur and cause related problems because, as a fat-soluble supplement, it's stored in the body's fat and can accumulate. However, if it's taken with vitamin K2, it's partly responsible for clearing out these accumulations. On the other hand, with a simple analysis, we could see if there's accumulation. If our vitamin D is within range, there's no accumulation. regardless the dose we take, is this 100% true? On the other hand, I haven't found any supplements with such a low dose, and I see that everyone takes 2,000, 4,000, 10,000, even 50,000 a day and is prescribed by their doctor, and they don't have any problems.

"IIL Syntha6 and Fairlife, WEWIL","Looking for recommendations for protein powders. I've tried a lot of things (ISO 100, PE Science, Ghost, Syntha6, Fairlife, Muscle Milk and Pure Protein), but the only thing I've actually liked are the Syntha6 Ultra premium protein matrix (not their isolate powder, haven't tried their edge powder) and the Fairlife premade protein drinks. 

I would be fine with just these two if it weren't for a couple things:

1) Syntha6 doesn't have the best protein/calorie ratio. I usually don't mind the 200 calories for 22g protein, especially with 6g of fiber, but sometimes I'd like a lower calorie option (these also tend to have more protein). 

2) Fairlife shakes can be on the expensive side, and have a lot more microplastics per serving than other shakes/powders (I don't really want to get into a microplastics debate here, it's only one factor in the equation here). 

All the other protein powders/shakes I tried I've either hated the texture, the taste, or both. They all taste WAY too sweet to me, and it's a cloying artificial sweetness that's even worse.  I'd say Fairlife is actually pretty sweet too, but with its texture it doesn't bother me, and the sweetness tastes more natural. Plus Fairlife vanilla + matcha or Thai tea is just too delicious...

So, is there any other powder or shake I should try that I might enjoy based on this? Or should I just stick with the Syntha6 and the occasional Fairlife treat?

Solutions: Creatine Sleep Issues,"I posted a comment a year or two ago where I resolved sleep issues on creatine by switching to a different formulation. As far as I know, no one else has posted a solution outside of dosing creatine monohydrate earlier in the day, and the solution itself is surprisingly simple. 

Formatted for brevity.

**Step 1: Ignore anyone who says Creatine does not cause any sleep problems.** There is plenty of documention from folks experiencing the same. There are subjective experiences on the Internet that date back for years, so it’s poor reasoning that others feel this is some sort of conspiracy.

**Step 2: Switch from Creatine Monohydrate to Creatine HCl or CGP Creatine.** Taking either of these alternative formulations, I did not have sleep issues.

**Step 3: Enjoy your sleep.** If either of the creatine formulations don’t work for you, there are plenty more alternative formulations you can keep trying (eg Magnesium Creatine Chelate, etc), until you find one that does work for you. Initially I thought it was the brand, so I switched between different brands of monohydrate, but it was actually the formulation that was the issue for me.

**What if the solution does not work?**
If you persist in your sleep issues after trying multiple alternatives, it is likely not the formulation that is the issue, but the creatine itself— at which point it’s likely better to stop dosing creatine altogether.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jcy818/solutions_creatine_sleep_issues/,1742165918.0

Supplement advice for a growing dude!,"“Growing dude” might be a bit of an exaggeration for my age, but I’m determined to transform my body, especially during my final term of university. I’m a 29-year-old Filipino man, and I’m on the chubbier side, weighing around 105 kilograms. My goal is to achieve the physique of a roadhog from Overwatch, prioritizing functional strength over aesthetics.

I’ve been consistently going to the gym for almost three months now, and this is the longest streak I’ve ever maintained. I’m incredibly proud of my progress. Currently, I’m following Torokhtiy’s Weightlifting and bodybuilding routine. While I’ve done routines in the past few years, I’ve always had a tendency to give up once the program ends.

My diet has been on track, ensuring that I’m getting enough protein. Most days are successful in meeting my nutritional goals, but there have been a few instances where it’s been a bit of a struggle.

As for supplements, I’m currently taking 10 grams of creatine per day with 2 portions of protein, but that’s the only two supplements I’m using.

So, I’m seeking advice on what other supplements I should consider incorporating into my routine to support my fitness goals.

Stack Feedback,"24 F active lifestyle and struggling with general fatigue brain fog and extremely poor sleep also diagnosed POTS which im on metoprolol and guanfacine for i want to get my vit b12 D and iron levels up. I have some issues with food and there are just a lot of foods i dont eat so i definitely want to cover for my restricted diet, i eat lots of chicken most fruits and some starches and sweets, broccoli is the only veggie i eat most of the time and I eat beef and pork and tofu less frequently and I do not eat fish but i do eat seaweed.

I'm looking to restart my vitamin stack as i did not end up liking the vitamins i was previously using, garden of life, extremely smelly, expensive and i found out they're owned by nestle. I am particularly trying to avoid excessive B6 and am looking something covering all trace minerals I might need and using optimal forms of vitamins.

I was looking at the [life extensions prenatal advantage](https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item02319/prenatal-advantage) to start because it has pretty much everything i could think of and it also does not mega dose on every vitamin. Im not pregnant it just seems like a good formula Alternatively I was considering getting [this ](https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item01328/only-trace-minerals)trace mineral complex but im not sure which things i would want to add to this in that case,does anyone have a suggestion for a fat-soluble vitamin complex to go with this? between that or the prenatal which would be better?

Am also considering adding the following

Iron [nutricost iron for women ](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Women-Capsules-Vitamin-Folate/dp/B09XZJYD4Y)\- this complex looks best since it also has vit C methylb12 and folate i would be taking every other day i am a little worried the 27mg of iron in the prenatal will interfere with absorption?

[D3 with k2 and iodine from life extensions ](https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item02040/vitamins-d-and-k-with-sea-iodine)\- not sure if the 1000IU from the prenatal is going to be enough to raise my levels, I read that you're supposed to take vitamin D with K but is it really ok to take this much?

Boron 2mg/day considering this but on the fence there seems to be pros and cons

Fish Oil/Omega 3s - TBH im still really skeptical i actually need this and also dont see myself choking down 6 pills a day of just fish oil

I am also taking magnesium glycinate avg 100mg a day and lots of electrolyte drinks as needed to keep hydration up nothing fancy just sodium and potassium.

Any good supplements for focus?,I haven’t been diagnosed with anything despite going to two therapists so I don’t have adhd or anything of that matter so adderall would be way too much for me not to mention it is prescription. I see so many supplements online for focus and it all seems like a scam to me. I’m just wondering if anyone has personally tried something specifically to help me focus/be motivated on my homework. I’m not gonna trust a company selling the product I need personal experiences. It could be a daily thing for the entire day or just to help for a few hours. I know motivation is mental but I think it would improve if the homework didn’t take hours to do because there is always something. I use caffeine when I do homework but it doesn’t really improve my focus. It improves a little bit not enough to make homework efficient. I am 18 so hopefully that broadens what I can use.

Does magnesium need thiamine? Or just the other way around?,"
I historically have not tolerated magnesium well and I have a bunch of symptoms of deficiency (chronic constipation, poor blood sugar regulation, brain fog, hormonal imbalances, muscle cramps/twitches, etc.) 

I want to try again (eek) much slower—even though before, I only had ~300mg which caused a reaction. (My negative response was a huge wave of anhedonia, blankness, dissociation; which I’ve since read happens to other people too.) 

I have seen posts and comments about thiamine. I’m cautious because it’s a histamine liberator and I have histamine intolerance/MCAS. From what I’ve read, it looks like thiamine can deplete magnesium… but is it the other way around too? Does magnesium “need” thiamine?

For context, I’m an undermethylator and as I said, have hormonal imbalances and MCAS. I eat low carb because I’m insulin resistant.

ED @ 34,"34 M
Libido in the toilet 
5'10, 180lb, healthy, active, about 14% bf.

Taking only a daily multi vitamin and creatine, though I heard creatine can mess with brain serotonin levels which regulates sex drive so I discontinued it with seemingly no effect though it's only been a week. Also tried deloading from weights, 2xing hydration, more veggies/less processed food but to no avail.

The lack of morning wood seems to indicate a physiological problem rather than psychological. Plus I have a gf of 3 years so there's no real 'stage fright' element at this point. 

Currently consuming 1 alcoholic drink per night, and very sparingly consume caffeine (<200mg per week) as I'm sensitive to it. 

Beyond frustrated at this point. I'm guessing my next step is a full blood and hormone panel, but all the ones I've ever had are fine and I'm almost guaranteeing nothing is wrong with my t levels as my overall energy and lifestyle are currently as healthy as they've ever been.

Advice on supplement stack. Timing and any adjustments?,"

Hey everyone,

Looking for some advice on my current supplement stack – mainly around timing and whether I should add or remove anything. I’ve attached a picture of my current stack, but here’s a breakdown of what I take:
	•	Magnesium Glycinate – 650 mg every night (not in the picture)

	•	Vitamin D3 – 10,000 IU once weekly (not in the picture)

	•	Vitamin B12 – 500 mcg daily

	•	Zinc – 50 mg twice a week

	•	Boron – 6 mg daily (split into two 3 mg doses)

	•	Fish Oil (Swisse 4x Strength) – 1 softgel daily 
	
•	CalDveg – Calcium, Vitamin K2, and D3 combo – everyday

Haven’t Started Yet (Need Advice):
	•	NAC – 600 mg daily

	•	L-Carnitine L-Tartrate – 2g before workouts

	•	Acetyl L-Carnitine – 500 mg in the morning on rest days

	•	Caffeine + L-Theanine – 100 mg + 200 mg before workouts or when I need focus

	•	Collagen Builder – Planning to start daily

	•	Astaxanthin – 4 mg daily

My goals are fat loss and muscle gain. I’m also trying to improve sleep and recovery.

Any advice on the ideal timing for these? Also, should I add or remove anything based on my goals?

The potential danger of over supplementing,"I've been exploring causes and potential cures for aortic aneurysms and have been discovering some hard truths that I felt I should share. First off, the use of NAD precursors is linked to CVD risk: [A terminal metabolite of niacin promotes vascular inflammation and contributes to cardiovascular disease risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38374343/) ""Collectively, these results indicate that the terminal breakdown products of excess niacin, 2PY and 4PY, are both associated with residual CVD risk. They also suggest an inflammation-dependent mechanism underlying the clinical association between 4PY and MACE"".

Also worrying is the activity of Betanin, Curcumin, Resveratrol, Berberine, Baicalin Baicalein, Genistein, Gedunin, and Klotho which all affect TGFb1 and SMAD pathways; unfortunately this are all associated with development of aortic aneurysms. 

I've just scratched the surface, but [I've written a little more on this reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/aortic_aneurysm/comments/1j6bdnv/how_to_reverse_these_dilations/?sort=new) and invite more experienced practitioners to help figure this out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jceqjb/the_potential_danger_of_over_supplementing/,1742103665.0

"Question about being prescribed 50,000 IU of vitamin D","I’ve been taking vitamin D for a year everyday at normal doses as prescribed by my doctor, but my levels were still low a year later. So now she is prescribing 50,000 a week for a whole year…does that sound right? I was told to schedule a test in a year to see where I am at. But that sounds weird to me. Shouldn’t I get tested sooner than that to know if it’s working? I’m going to listen to my doctor but I think I might get a second opinion because I’ve been feeling paranoid all week. 

EDIT: thank you for the feedback, I’m still waiting to get the results in the mail, it’s been 10 days since I had the blood drawn and the nurse called me last Monday over the phone and gave me a summary. I was prescribed 2 antibiotics to clear out the bacteria overgrowth, so I think that is what the problem is. I still have 3 days left of theses antibiotics, crossing my fingers! so I should’ve just waited till I had all the numbers in front of me before posting sorry 😅

But even with all of that info missing these replies have been SO HELPFUL and I’ve read through all of them. I was taking a 5,000 unit with K2 at the same time daily, and magnesium glycinate at night. I’ve been doing this for a whole year RARELY missing a dose. But now I realize that would be 35,000 unit a week and I’m now doing 50,000 a week so it’s not a huge difference! 

Thank you again my nerves have been put at ease. I don’t have great insurance so it takes about 2 months to get in with this doctor but I’m crossing my fingers that the bacteria gets destroyed by these antibiotics and my body can absorb vitamin D again!

Maybe Having a Bad Experience With Betalanine,"So, I read that beta-alanine was supposed to be great for working out and a bunch of other things (inflammation, etc.), but I am falling apart on it.

I swear, as I've become fully loaded on it (I took 6 grams for 6 weeks and have now been taking 3 grams once a day for the past week), I've had more aches and pains in general and also while working out.

[Seeking Help] Supplements for Anxiety – Feeling Desperate,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with anxiety for a while, and I’m really hoping to find something that actually helps. I’ve tried:

* Magnesium Glycinate – Minimal impact (Doesn't seem to help me at all. Been taking it for a while)
* L-Theanine – Barely noticeable, even at higher doses (took 800mg and felt nothing)
* Ashwagandha – Didn’t feel anything 
* THC - Makes me more paranoid if anything
* Alcohol - Works but obviously very bad for me and makes me stupid

At this point, I’m feeling desperate. I’m open to trying other supplements, but I don’t want to waste time on things that won’t work. I’ve heard about things like GABA, Rhodiola, 5-HTP, and even NAC, but I don’t know if any of them are worth it.

Has anyone found something that genuinely helps take the edge off anxiety? Ideally, something noticeable that doesn’t completely sedate me or wreck my focus.

Fish oil and hyperlipidemia,"Recently I've had my blood work done and my lipid profile is in a dangerous territory. Now, before you all tell me to get on statins, well, I'll consider it in due time. I will focus first on a complete shift in my life that should have already happened – diet, exercise, sleep, and supplementation lol. This is where you guys come in.

So I know that fish oil (specifically, omega-3s) reduces triglyceride levels if taken in larger amounts if I'm not mistaken. But what about reducing LDL and increasing HDL? I'm currently taking ""Jamieson Omega-3 Extra Strength 700mg"" which has 420mg EPA and 280mg DHA and it was literally the strongest available in the pharmacy. On the bottle it states that it's good for cholesterol however I found some contradictory evidence wherein DHA was found to increase LDL.

Without focusing on my diet, would you recommend fish oil or not for hyperlipidemia? If yes, what dosage and what should be the EPA:DHA ratio? Do you have a supplement brand for fish oil to recommend in Europe? I don't care if it's American, Canadian or European... I just want it to be safe and efficient.

Also, is Jamieson any good? I've heard Canada has better control over supplements than US or even EU due to their pre-market release testing or whatever. I see that no one is mentioning that so let me be the first. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jc737h,1742078378.0

Are anxiety and depression levels extremely high in supplement communities?,"I have a very strong belief from being a bit too into the community over 5 years ago, that yes, the community is self-medicating.  And a large chunk is fixable issues, which include, hopefully, transient depression/anxiety.  

What seems to be a common narrative is a perceived issue, which can be real but blown up to the Nth degree by personal perception, which is then fixed by this supplement, no wait this one was the answer all along…help the supplement that was the answer is starting to cause issues.  

It’s a common line of a brain getting stuck somewhere and thinking the answer is purely something out of their hands that can be fixed by something outside of them.  And yes supplements will help deficiency issues, but that’s not what a user with a “stack” does.  Anyone with issues gets it addressed and moves on.  Someone with a stack is focusing on a narrow journey, and that journey needs to be meaningful to justify a stack that is perceived to help.  They’re constantly looking to optimize, when it’s likely they’re not optimizing whatsoever.  They’re just making things more tunnel vision to accomplish a goal, and shutting out a bigger picture to get it done, and maybe a more relaxed and open reality.  A huge generalization, but it is a worrying trend, especially because belief in these communities tend to be so strong it’s unlikely to convince someone of an opposing stance, unless you say “this thing made me feel better.”

They want research, as if research actually addresses perfectly addresses contextual situation.  It does give you interesting tidbits to follow, but not when you read a study that says “positive effect” and you go to a supplement site/store 10 minutes later to order something.  That’s self-medication.

One trend that is more concerning is people so sure of something they will tell others what they should take, what dose, and what it will do.  As if they understand the true interactions in the body.

There needs to be a reminder we all want the best for you, and we don’t want you to feel you need all these thjngs to feel well.  You need a vivid life with connections to keep you feeling well, obviously address any health issues, think about new ways to engage yourself so you’re not always just living the same perception, and keep pushing toward new ideas and feelings slowly.

Ubiquinol helps me with sensory processing,"I have ADHD, and one of my symptoms is that it's sometimes hard to piece together different parts of sensory input. For example, it can be be difficult to listen to someone in a noisy environment or to follow along to the lyrics of a song while listening to the instrumentals.

I've noticed some gradual improvement in this area in terms of focusing on what someone is saying by taking antioxidant supplements. However, nothing quite flipped a switch.

I tried ubiquinol, which is a form of Coenzyme Q10 that's considered to be more bioavailable, and it helps me with these sensory issues. It's subtle in general but apparent when listening to music. Everything ""comes together"" like I guess it's supposed to sound to normal people.

I originally tried the ubiquinol for fatigue, but the benefit it has for treating oxidative stress is offering me something else. Maybe in a way it is treating a symptom of mental fatigue.

Opinions about tongkat ali,"Hi guys,

So as the title says I'm thinking about hoping on tongkat ali for 8 weeks (a typical 5 days on 2 days off cycle) due to a recent t-test that was quite low and lower than expected (which makes sense because I have been stressed out of my mind for the last few months and my cortisol is high), anyways, the plan is to use it to help me lower the cortisol and boost natural T production so I can get back to regular levels and get back to more a more regular, enjoyable life quality. 

The question is: I'm scared this might have some side effects and looking around the internet everyone keeps saying it's safe and medical doctors in my country aren't really aware of the literature on it, so I thought I would ask the question here: 

is this a bad decision? And is there a chance I might be shutting down my natural production somehow by hopping on?

Low libido,"Hello, to start, I’m a 24-year-old man. A year ago, I experienced low testosterone for the first time. I started noticing a decrease in libido, which was strange because I had always had a high sex drive. I took testosterone tests, and indeed, my levels were well below the normal range.

I’m not obese, but I did gain body fat—about 5 noticeable kilos. I started to worry and took the gym more seriously than before. After three months of training, my testosterone levels increased, but they were still slightly below the normal range.

My urologist didn’t inspire much confidence in me, but he prescribed a Nebido injection. I decided to follow his advice and got the injection, but I didn’t feel any real effects.

Help with creatine insomnia?,"For the past 2 weeks I’ve been taking 5g of Creatine HCL every morning per my rheumatologist’s order (I have very low muscle tone and a connective tissue disorder so the goal is to put on 5-10lbs of muscle mass to help the pain). 

Thus far it’s kind of been a miracle, the creatine has completely zapped my brain fog and exhaustion associated with my various conditions without the anxiety side-effect that caffeine gives me. I do feel stronger too (I know at this point, any weight gain is probably just water retention). 

So I really don’t wanna give it up. 

However- the sleep, oh god, the sleep. I go to bed just fine but routinely wake up around 3-5AM. If it’s a weekend, I can fall back asleep for a bit around 6 but if it’s a workday I’m just SOL. I don’t feel anxious, stressed, or anything with my mental state. Just feels like falling asleep is….blocked somehow. So I’ve been running on 5-6 hours of sleep. I actually feel pretty fine during the day (because creatine) but obviously that’s not enough.

I really don’t want to give it up, not even because *gains* or whatever, because frankly I haven’t had much. It’s just been kind of a miracle tool for my energy, mental state, and chronic pain.

Issue with magnesiumbisglycinat and caffeine - help,"I recently took 3 grams of magnesium bisglycinate, and I’m still feeling the effects 15 hours later. I feel completely exhausted, unable to do anything, just lying in bed resting. The same thing happens with caffeine—it stays in my system for an unusually long time, sometimes over a full day. If I drink caffeine early in the morning, I struggle to fall asleep at night and still feel its effects when I wake up. Caffeine now makes me feel very stimulated.

I’m starting to wonder if I have difficulty metabolizing substances. I have a history of over 10 years of polysubstance abuse, mixing various drugs with alcohol. However, I’ve been completely clean for over 5 years now. Could my past substance use have caused some kind of imbalance in my body?

Are there any tests I can take to check if everything is functioning as it should? It feels like I’ve become extremely sensitive to everything, and I don’t seem to tolerate substances the way I used to. This doesn’t feel normal.

I’d appreciate any insights or advice!

I have DBH enzyme deficiency. Is it dangerous to take 2 mg of copper supplements daily?,"I probably have a mutation in DBH, which means I can't convert dopamine to noradrenaline properly.



So I started taking 2mg of copper, and my ADHD improved a lot.



But I learned through reddit that copper is a very dangerous substance.



So my questions are:



1. Is it dangerous to take 2mg of copper supplements every day?



2. There are various ways to check if you are taking too much copper, but what is the most reliable test? Would a blood test be helpful?



3. Are there any supplements that I should take together with copper supplements?



4. Are there any other diseases or neurological problems that I should be concerned about? (I have been diagnosed with ADHD and CFS)



Here are my reactions to supplements and psychiatric medications



Zinc → I become manic



Vitamin B complex (supplements containing various types of vitamin B) → I have tinnitus and forgetfulness



Vitamin C → I become fatigued



Psychologic medications that increase dopamine → All of them make me manic and do not improve ADHD at all (concerta, pemolin, etc.)



Medicines that increase noradrenaline → ADHD is greatly improved, and chronic fatigue and brain fog are greatly reduced



That's how it is.

Also, probably because I was exposed to chronic stress for a while, my cortisol level is abnormally low (I found this out after being hospitalized for tests. Cortisol is 1.0-2.0, Arch is about 7)



ADHD and CFS have made my life a mess. If you have any advice, please let me know.

Do psychiatric drugs have anything to do with methylation？,"I am a Japanese university student with ADHD and CFS.

SNRIs were effective for me until a certain point, but after performing a very difficult task (cognitively and physically demanding), SNRIs stopped working at all.

And recently, I read an article that said exercise intolerance in CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) is related to folic acid.

This is just my amateur speculation, but is there any relationship between the effectiveness of psychiatric drugs, methylation, and chronic fatigue?

I think that (although not everything can be explained centrally) the phenomenon of psychiatric drugs becoming ineffective is related to methylation and MTHFR, and can be explained by the fact that necessary neurotransmitters are not produced (or some kind of abnormality occurs). (Of course, I understand that there are multiple other reasons, such as problems with receptor downregulation)

What do you think about this?

I am ignorant of MTHFR, and it is a concept I have only recently learned about, so I would like to somehow link MTHFR to the poop out phenomenon, and more specifically, to the exercise intolerance in CFS, so that antidepressants will work again.

I would like to hear your opinions, no matter how trivial your hypotheses or knowledge.

Also, the concepts of MTHFR and methylation are not widely known in Japan, so if there are any sites, personal blogs, or pages of people with original ideas that explain them in detail, please let me know.

Sea buckthorn question,"I decided to take Sea buckthorn recently as I’ve found a few studies showing positive impact on collagen production and figured it was worth a shot. Most of the studies suggest somewhere between 3-4 g daily to see the effect. I was excited as I found this supplement (https://carlylenutritionals.com/products/sea-buckthorn-oil-4400-mg-softgels-200-count) which seemed like an easy way to hit that goalpost. However, once I received the product, I realized it’s actually an “extract” of sea buckthorn and not the oil + plant matter. 

My question is: will I still see an impact on collagen production using this product, or is having the raw content a better move? The studies seem to be reliant on actual plant matter but I guess I’m not 100% sure what the extracted form is. Would love any insights, thanks!

Help me understand this COA,"I have always been wary of supplements, but am now examining them as another tool to deal with post-covid brain fog. Life Extension was recommended to me by a family member, so I requested a third-party partyCertificate of Analysis for some of their products. The image was my response.

As I have little experience with supplements COAs, I have a few concerns:

* The tests seem to be done by Life Extension themselves, I do not see any 3rd parties mentioned. This seems to be a concerning conflict of interest.
* The heavy metals testing seems vague, replacing the measured value with specifying that it meets the minimum requirements

This seems like the equivalent of ""just trust me, bro,"" for supplements. Am I being too cynical?

Berberine SEVERE constipation,"Heads up for those who are like me got seduced into using berberine to lower sugar levels, help with cravings and achieve low carb happiness: berberine is evil. 

I heard people saying it causes upset stomach but what I did not expect was SEVERE constipation. I am not prone to constipation, eat lots of fiber, always regular. Well, not anymore! 

After a few days of taking berberine I got literally cemented on inside. Breaking through this cement was super stressful, painful, exhausting and my sugar levels jumped as if I ate a huge cake in one sitting! Stress causes sugar spikes. 

I developed a fear of this repeating. At that point I thought it was a fluke. I hoped so. It wasn’t. 

From that point on it became my life. I blamed it on nuts. I always ate lots of nuts and never had an issue with elimination. I thought, it finally caught up with me. I stopped nuts. To no success. Then I realised that this inner cementing coincides with me starting berberine. I stopped taking it. 

The issue continued. In terms of eating, I developed a huge disgust to my staple foods: leafy greens, eggs, chicken, avocado. The moment I think of them, I gag. I NEVER had this reaction before! Instead, all I wanted was cake!!!! To the point that I had it. My sugar levels went through the roof. I continued being constipated. Usually, eating tons of carbs helps with bowel movement. Well, not anymore. 

Now I am a week off berberine after taking it for about 10 days total. I am still not okay. I am not cemented anymore, but I am numb and just do not go unless I stimulate the whole thing by using Fleet. 

I looked berberine up and saw many reviews that report severe constipation. I am hoping I will soon get restored. 

In terms of sugar control - this period of time on berberine resulted in EXTREMELY elevated sugar levels due to stress and disordered eating. 

Also, my sleep was messed up royally. Probably also due to berberine. Now when I am a week free of it, I see improvement. 

I will NEVER EVER take this evil thing again! This is the absolute nightmare.

The past week I have had horrible anxiety symptoms and I started to think that it could be caused by not taking ashwaghanda. This morning I decided to take 300mg to see if it would help.

Betaine HCL + Pepsin supplementation how to know if it is working,"I know there have already been some posts about betaine hcl + pepsin supplementation, but I still couldn't figure it out.

I suspect that I have low stomach acid. I did the baking soda test and nothing happened -- no gas or burping. I generally think its better to work with someone, but unfortunately I moved recently so I lost my old functional nutritionist and havent found a new one yet

  
I thought I would try betaine hcl + pepsin to see if it would help (my symptoms are chronic constipation, bloating, trapped intestinal gas, difficulty digesting food, heavy feeling after eating)

I'm taking Thorne Betaine HCL & Pepsin. I started with 2 capsules and keep increasing, and now am at 5 with each meal (so 10 a day) That seems like a lot and I dont want to do more harm than good to my body. However, I have not noticed anything, no burning sensation, etc. 

Does anyone have an inkling would this mean maybe low stomach acid is not my problem or should I keep increasing my capsules until I notice something. The bottle says 2 pills is 1 gram of betaine so right now I would be at 2.5g  per meal (so 5g a day. I only take at lunch and dinner as this is where my heavy protein meals are).

Question about magnesium glycinate for insomnia,"Hey y’all,

My question is about magnesium deficiency and sleep. If someone is suffering a heavy bout of insomnia and takes magnesium’s glycinate and it provides relief, does that automatically mean there is some level of deficiency in the first place? I know some people use it for insomnia and it does nothing or does the opposite affect. Is that because their cause of insomnia is not magnesium based but something else or does magnesium work regardless of your levels being normal? I’ve read that magnesium doesn’t help peoples insomnia when their levels are good because they are already producing the appropriate amount but I don’t know if that claim is legit.

"Turmeric megadosing with berberine, zinc, and NAC very likely gave me anemia, already teetering on the edge of it for a long time most likely","I wrote a reply to another post regarding this and am still waiting on appointments for blood tests, but I think this should be recorded for the archives. So it turns out that curcumin chelates iron, quite a lot actually. There is one recorded case of it decisively causing deficiency for a 66 y/o man taking 3g daily.

For about a month I took in the ballpark of 1.5 to 3g daily (1 to 1/2 teaspoon) as a tea with other things, cinnamon, cacao, etc. it seemed very beneficial for my fucked up gut microbiome (SIBO) so I included it as part of my protocol. This involved berberine which has well documented chelation for iron as well. NAC was also a component as a biofilm buster, and may be a weak copper chelator. There was also zinc carnosine which probably threw off my ratios for copper absorption. Only 15mg of elemental zinc, but when taken near mealtime it very likely is enough to thoroughly throw off the ratio. Finally, the restrictive diet for this protocol likely didn't have as much of both copper and iron, copper which is critical for iron mobilization into red blood cells.

The good new is that my protocol greatly improved my digestive symptoms, and nearly eradicated SIBO. Remains to be seen though, as it could be growing again now that I am slowly reintroducing foods. I continue to take ginger and artichoke extracts with every meal to ensure the motility and bile are high, addressing the root cause and preventing regrowth.

The first 5 days or so, turmeric on its own seemed almost like a cure! I felt so clear headed right after drinking turmeric tea in a way which clearly wasn't placebo. I wasn't adding black pepper or oils, so I have no idea how much I was actually absorbing, but it must've been doing something for body-wide inflammation caused by the metabolites and secretions of bacteria. I then read that it would not absorb well without those, so I started grinding black pepper into my tea along with a bit of coconut oil. It was subtle, but I believe it's around this moment that I began to lose the brainfog lifting effect and things took a turn for the worse again.

My insomnia and general fatigue progressively worsened again (fatigue but not really nodding off, feeling tired yet awake at the same time), depression, unexplained anxiety, poor mood, etc. I don't know for sure if it's always been exactly like this, but the color of my skin now as of today appears very off to a noticeable extent. Lifeless, zombie-like, especially obvious when standing next to other people it's like gray or green. It led me into another deep dive down memory lane, reviewing every single photo and selfie over years and years, and I discovered that I've most likely been borderline anemic. Especially photos around other people the contrast in skin tone is stark. The online resources on anemia all talk about ""pale skin"" but this is completely meaningless as chronically inside people are also ""pale"". Now that we're coming out of winter where nobody has had any sun, and comparing to other chronically inside folks, it's clear that there are two different kinds of pale. Theirs is like a lively pink color. It's pale, but it's still vibrant. Mine is like all the colors is being sucked out or my skin and looks transparent.

In hindsight there were a myriad of other clues that were even more obvious a decade ago in high school. Intense restless leg syndrome, needing the open up the window in winter at night because I was so hot I'd be drenched in sweats, meanwhile shivering at school at just room temperature, diagnosed ADHD which is now understood to be a common diagnostic for iron deficiency, chewing ice, so on and so forth. I'm not really sure what is the link with ice chewing or why it happens, I don't do that nowadays or crave it because it just seem dumb to me chewing ice, but I'm definitely still a texture guy, love my food very crunchy. The symptoms changed over the years as I grew older, got to a more healthy weight, eating more vegetables and less junk food, and becoming more physically active.

Still, when I should've been healthy I would be out of breath simply walking and struggling to hold a conversation walking at normal pace. I only recently noticed this could be linked to anemia while reading up on it. I always suspected something didn't quite add up, couldn't seem to build good cardio regardless of the effort I put in. I'd be jogging all summer every other day, and three months later still can't keep up pace with any of my buddies who are moderately active but not to this extent. I would and still get insanely tired as well after cardio, the day's basically over I can't work or do anything after. They're having a blast enjoying the weather and holding a conversation while I'm plugging 3 word sentences in-between breaths. I thought it was damage to my lungs from smoking weed, but now I'm not so sure it's to this extent? Shockingly I just learnt that smoking raises hemoglobin, so maybe that explains why I've always had such spontaneous clarity of mind after smoking weed compared to other people. But conversely some suggest it may impact iron uptake in the gut, so it'd be a vicious cycle. In hindsight it feels like my brain is telling me ""get this into your body asap to survive"" whenever there's weed around me, literally craving in the same way that people describe craving dirt or ice, like it will make me healthy or more functioning.

Anyway I'm trying to score an appointment with my GP and will request full comprehensive blood tests, RBC, iron panel, copper, B12, zinc, vitamin D, and any other relevant mineral and vitamin to confirm my suspicion soon. Stay safe everyone and get tested, supplements are no joke.

What ever happened to individually wrapped MRP shakes?,"I was 16-17 years old when they rolled around. To this day, absolutely nothing comes close to those OG Myoplex Deluxe shakes.

Labrada then came along and made his own and there were a bunch of others. I found these single serving packs to be absolutely convenient and clutch. So much more convenient and lugging around a jug of Redcon MRE. Seems like there is a massive aversion to carbs as the market seemingly is all pure protein shakes in jugs.

"New dad, sleep-deprived — Looking for supplement recommendations to support brain & body","Hey everyone,

I recently became a dad, and while it's been an amazing experience, the lack of sleep is really starting to wear me down. It’s been about a month of broken sleep, and I expect this to continue for another 1-2 months at least.

I’m looking for supplements that can help mitigate the effects of sleep deprivation — something to support brain function, energy levels, and overall recovery. I understand nothing can replace proper sleep, but anything to help me stay sharp and resilient would be greatly appreciated.

Would love to hear what’s worked for you or any science-backed recommendations!

"Vitamin E, K², D³, B-Complex, Magnesium Recommendations","I wanted to ask for recommendations for all natural, AFFORDABLE, vegan/vegetarian, vitamins. Specially, Vitamin E and K². 

I currently take Nature's Bounty®️ SUPER B-Complex with Folic Acid + Vitamin C, Nature's Bounty®️ D³ 125 mcg - 5,000 IU, & Magnesium (unsure of amount or brand [will check once home] from Poland 🇵🇱 AM & PM.

My vitamin E and D are low. I also suffer with autoimmune disease - Fibromyalgia: high RA Factor (48, was 69, out of a low #) & CRP (recently, 12 out of 10), IBS-C (medication makes it worse), and Mental Health (social anxiety, depression, ADHD, BPD). The autoimmune disease is bad because I'm too weak/fatigued & chronic pain to function almost daily, without meds, so I want to look at natural treatments. 

I read that if your Vitamin D & Selenium is low you'll probably have autoimmune issues. We Selenium is fine, but Vitamin D² is low. [Vitamin D² turns into D³ in your body, FYI, PCP told me.] Also taking Vitamin D deplets your Vitamins A, E, K². [Think I'm missing a vitamin.] This is from researching the web and also Dr. Berg YouTube videos. 

I shop at ShopRite®️ and they only mainly have 4 different brands: Nature's Bounty®️, Nature's Made®️, Nature's Truth®️, and their ShopRite®️ brand.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated! 

Again, I'm looking for/need natural, AFFORDABLE, Vitmains D³ 125mcg - 5,000 IU (low levels, autoimmune disease, poor sunlight), B-Complex (I haven't eaten meat in years), Magnesium (anxiety, chronic pain, better sleep), and specially Vitamins E (low levels, very dry skin, scars, hair falling out, poor night eyesight, needed with Vitamin D³) and K² (needed with Vitamin D³).

L-tyrosine and how it enhances the effects of stimulants,"Disclaimer i am not a profesional and these are only MY observations. 

L-tyrosine by it self makes me more awake and motivated but nit to the point where i really notice it, but when i combine it with a stimulant like caffeine it has synergy that i have never expected it to have. When combining caffeine and L-tyrosine i sometimes get into an almost hypomanic state. These effects ussualy last 2.5 hours with noticable crash afterwards. 

My theory is that caffeine is stimulating the release of dopamine but by it self it cant really do that much. But when combined with L-tyrosine i gets the “materials” (dopamine) and the caffeine releases the L-tyrosine’s dopamine so there is a lot more dopamine in the brain then normaly. 

Im not good at explaining stuff so sorry it isnt understandable and if you want to try this combination of caffeine and L-tyrosine let me know your resoults. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jahknu/ltyrosine_and_how_it_enhances_the_effects_of/,1741886994.0

I was permanently and severely damaged by a medication I took in 2019.,"
Yes, this is all 100% true. Please don’t say “that’s not possible.” If you feel that way just move on from my post. Thanks. In July of 2019 I went on an SSRI antidepressant called Celexa for generalized anxiety disorder. I quit taking it after about 25 days because it made me totally numb and lose all pleasure and function, including sexual. I couldn’t feel emotions or even an orgasm at all. Unfortunately after quitting I stayed this way and am still stuck like this over 5 years later. 0% improvements. It is devastating beyond belief. I can’t explain the misery of this. 24/7 hell on Earth. The condition is called r/pssd. There is no treatment or cure and most Doctors don’t know a thing about it. I live everyday 100% numb all because I took a common medication short term over 5 years ago. The worst part to me is numb genitals and zero feeling/pleasure in orgasms. 

List of things I’ve tried (some worked, but only for a few days and then never worked again):

MACA,
TONGKAT,
SHILAJIT,
TYROSINE,
CORDYCEPS,

High b1 (thiamine) in serum,"Hello, I have neuropathy and spinal cord pain due to ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone toxicity). A while ago, in November, I started taking B1 (sulbutiamine) and B12 (methyl) supplements. Initially, it was great, my neuropathy decreased. 

I took the supplements for 45 days, but after 45 days, my body started to become intolerant to B1. Every time I took it, I began experiencing spine problems, difficulty holding my head upright (cervical instability?), neuropathy, loss of sensation in my legs, balance issues, and I stopped taking the thiamine supplement. I stopped taking B1 and B12 for a few months, but every time I had a blood test, my serum B1 levels were higher than expected. 

I tested one month apart without taking any b supplements, and in one test, the level was 76, and in the other, it was 79 (the normal range should be 25-75). I don’t know why this is happening, as B1 is usually excreted from the body when no supplements are taken, but my levels are high. 

When I researched possible causes, I found issues like kidney problems, leaky gut syndrome, problems with enzymes that transport B1 into cells, deficiencies in other cofactors, and oxidative stress. 

Recently, I tried 100mg of thiamine HCL again, and I had reactions like chills, feeling unwell, and increased neuropathy (possibly histamine problems?). Since I didn't have issues with other B vitamins(normal in blood), I thought B1 might not be able to enter my cells, so I did an IM B-complex injection. I experienced some anaphylaxis-like symptoms but after felt that most of my symptoms improved.

At this point, I’m unsure what the problem is. Could it be that the B1 absorbed from the intestines cannot enter the cells? What can I do? Should I try other fat-soluble forms like benfotiamine? 

Also, I noticed that whenever I smoke, my spine pain worsens (nicotine depletes B1 and B6).

"DIM, Saw Palmetto & Silymarin Helped My PCOS—Can I Continue DIM While TTC?","Hey everyone,

I’m 28F, and I’ve been struggling with PCOS for years. After seeing 30+ doctors, being misdiagnosed, and gaslit repeatedly, I finally took matters into my own hands. I got a full hormonal panel done and confirmed I had PCOS with the following imbalances:

-High DHEAS, Androstenedione, Prolactin, and Estrogen
-Low SHBG

I dealt with severe cystic acne that made me unrecognizable in just two years—nothing worked, not even lasers or microneedling. Then came the weight gain, which wouldn't budge no matter how much I ate clean, exercised, and weight-trained.

A few months ago, I started supplementing with:
-DIM
- Saw Palmetto
-Silymarin (Milk Thistle)

This combination changed everything for me. My acne improved, my weight started responding, and I finally felt some control over my body again.

Now, I’m trying to conceive and recently had an IUI done. My question is:
Is it safe to continue taking DIM while trying to get pregnant?

Can't Get Zinc Up,"I've been high dosing zinc for years -- 1000% RDA from different forms like oxide, citrate, gluconate, and for the better part of the last year, picolinate -- and I can't get my zinc up or my copper down. No known source of copper that would be blocking anything, so I don't get it. No copper IUD. Molybdenum didn't bring copper down either. 

Am I doing something wrong? Should I be taking even higher doses to correct the deficiency? Could something be blocking the zinc from absorbing? I'd love some input, because this is very annoying. My copper:zinc ratio is real bad with the zinc outright low and the copper outright high. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ja3pb8/cant_get_zinc_up/,1741839089.0
Need suggestions for SSRI alternatives,"So I am a Chronic Procrastinator all my life. I was super convinced that I have ADHD PI given my chronic procrastination and many other ADHD symptoms. 

My Psychiatrist ruled out ADHD and instead wanted to put me on SSRIs for Anxiety and Mild Depression. However, I refused SSRIs out of the sheer fear I have for them given the various horror stories I have read about them for years on Reddit.

What supplement options do I have for managing my Anxiety as well as increasing my motivation(even if by a bit.) I zeroed in on L Tyrosine, L theanine and Caffeine. Would Tryptophan due to it being a Sertonin precusor be a better fit?

How much does it matter if a magnesium supplement isn’t third party tested?,"I've been using Sam's club (members mark) magnesium glycinate for several months now. It seems to be working fine, and I like it because it also has l theanine which I want, so it saves me from having to buy that separately.

Sam's club also just had a lawsuit where their tumeric had way less than advertised, although that may be different since magnesium is a mineral. So how much does it matter if a supplement isn't tested or verified?
If I decide to switch, I was gonna go to nature's bounty for magnesium. I'm sure it's not the highest quality but it's still cheap and it's at least lab tested- I think USP certified.

Creatine & Sleep disturbances,"I started taking 3 g creatine about a month ago (I'm a 47 year old female), and in the past week notice that Im waking up two times a night (usually around 1 and 3 am) and feel completely wide awake. I go through a mental body relaxation and get back to sleep, but it's a strange feeling because I am SO cogently awake. It's actually becoming unnerving...

I noticed right after I started taking it that when I wake up in the mornings, I'm so ready to go - in a good way. I don't drag out of bed anymore. I still feel that way.

I checked my fitbit data and even though I have these clear as day awakenings, my total sleep time and awake time during sleep  is no different than it was pre-creatine, and my sleep score on average is higher now. I don't have any fatigue during the day from the nighttime awakenings.

Even so, it's hard to believe this can be healthy for me, even though I feel fine during the day. It's starting to make me nervous about wakefulness during the night. Thoughts on what's happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1j9z9jr/creatine_sleep_disturbances/,1741825398.0
Enhancing Creativity: MACA + Erinamax + THC,"
Posted this on the ND Subreddit but wanted to bring this to a wider audience. 

THC + MACA + ERINAMAX = Extended Coding Flow

Been testing THC after MACA and Erinamax (1 capsule of each in the morning) and it seems to improve my creativity and problem solving during extended programming/coding sessions. It’s also stimulating/energizing which is nice. 

It’s hard to explain exactly what it does but it seems like I can connect dots between ideas more easily and I’m spontaneously coming up with cool creative ideas more frequently while on it.  


- MACA – Modulates dopamine & endocannabinoid activity, potentially smoothing out THC’s effects and reducing cognitive “scatter”. I suspect the endocannabinoid activity is a major player in this stack’s effects. 

- Erinamax (Lion’s Mane Mycelium – Erinacine A) – Boosts NGF (nerve growth factor), supporting neuroplasticity, which might help with holding complex data structures in mind while coding.

- THC – I take a low-ish dose like 5mg and it feels more dialed in with the above two noots. Like I’m navigating through ideas and code more effectively.

Anyone else notice this kind of synergy for deep work?

Fluoride causes diabetes?,"Holy shit 

Am I understanding this correctly 

Would we be able to find a graph of fluoride introduction to public water and see if this correlates to the rise in rate of diabetes

Edit

1930s:
Scientists discovered that small amounts of fluoride naturally occurring in water could protect teeth from decay. 

1940s:
The idea of artificially adding fluoride to public water supplies to achieve the same effect arose. 

1945:
Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city in the world to intentionally fluoridate its water supply. 

1962:
The United States Public Health Service (PHS) recommended that public water supplies contain fluoride to help prevent tooth decay. 

1970s, the incidence of diabetes was the lowest, at 2.0 percent among women and 2.7 percent among men. 

1973:
A consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was acceptable. 

Results from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report showed that between 1980 and 1994 the incidence of self-reported cases of type 2 diabetes increased significantly

1994
The CDC declared diabetes an epidemic.

1999:
The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water as one of 10 great public health interventions of the 20th century. 

2010:
Over 200 million Americans had access to fluoridated water in their public water systems. 

2020:
About 73% of the US population with public water access got drinking water with fluoride

Collagen causing widespread tendon inflammation?,"I started taking 10 grams bovine collagen peptides in powder form about 2 weeks ago to help rehab what seemed like an overuse injury in my finger.

I went to the doctor and he recommended I stop taking the collagen but 10 days later I still hurt all over. It seems like he was right that it was the collagen, as it is better than it was.

Pumpkin seed oil vs water soluble extract - which is more beneficial?,"I am wondering which one would be more effective for any issue we might want to try pumpkin seed?

Now, I’m on oral minoxidil for 4 months and have an astounding zero results. I’m trying to hold off on finasteride because I had gynecomastia from puberty for which I had surgery and am scared of recurrence.

That being said I ordered pumpkin seed extract. Y life extension under the impression that it is more effective however now I am not so sure.

Boron - dispelling the myth,"What is the deal with Boron?

Despite being one of the most commonly recommended supplements here, **credible long-term research on its benefits and safety seems almost nonexistent**.

Mainstream science largely considers it under-researched, with no conclusive evidence proving its benefits or long-term safety - [https://examine.com/supplements/boron/?show\_conditions=true](https://examine.com/supplements/boron/?show_conditions=true)



The most commonly cited study in favor of boron is the infamous and deeply flawed *“Nothing Boring About Boron.” -* [*https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4712861/*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4712861/)  
  
It was authored by **Lara Pizzorno**, who works for the medical advisory board of a company that sells boron supplements - [https://www.algaecal.com/company/](https://www.algaecal.com/company/)

* It was published in a journal specializing in **“alternative therapies,”** where the **editor-in-chief is the author’s husband**.
* The paper heavily cites **poorly controlled studies** with small sample sizes, often lacking control groups.

Other studies have found contradicting results, one that it raises estrogen and boron should therefore by cycled. Whilst another study found that it lowered estrogen. Both were short term and small sample groups.  
  
 

To be clear, I'm not saying Boron definitely has no benefits. It seems for certain conditions it *might* be beneficial. Anecdotally some people report benefits, whilst others who've actually tracked supplementation with bloodwork found no benefits - [https://www.reddit.com/r/MacroFactor/comments/1ftobcb/thoughts\_on\_boron\_as\_supplement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacroFactor/comments/1ftobcb/thoughts_on_boron_as_supplement/)  
  
**But for your average person I am wondering where the credible evidence is for taking Boron? And what indications are there of long term safety?**

\--------

Here's some further criticism of the Nothing Boring About Boron paper, quoting another redditor u/docjitters comments in a separate thread:

In short, it’s a *car crash* of a paper. It commits a few academic sins, this highlights of which are:

* makes prominent declarative statements in the intro and summary without quoting the evidence in the paper (like “\[B\] is essential for the growth and maintenance of bone”)
* describes multiple chemical and molecular reactions involving boron but not how it might affect the targets of treatment e.g. describing at length about Lewis acid formation, but not why it might be relevant; describing how boron may have helped establish life on Earth through stabilising riboses (as a precursor to RNA) but this doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with its benefit to the human organism itself. Citing a study (in French?) on how boron ‘improves wound healing’ - applied *to* the wound as boric acid (it’s a widely-used antiseptic) - but omitting to discuss this might be as an antimicrobial, and not as a supplement.
* conflating a boron-induced effect with benefit regarding the outcomes of disease e.g. increasing free testosterone, but not how this would benefit a human in practise (who would likely not be testosterone deficient anyway).
* outright misstates its references e.g. ‘[this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17419890/) states areas with higher boron consumption have lower osteoarthritis’ - it does not.
* some papers [it cites](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22435474/) (again regarding OA treated with boron) show impressive outcomes (reduction in pain and stiffness) *in small groups without a control group*. The oft-cited [Australian pilot study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13590849009003147) (incidentally co-authored by Rex Newnham, someone openly enthusiastic as to the benefits of boron, and who is a naturopath) of 20 patients which *is* placebo-controlled doesn’t say how they controlled for painkiller use (which they admit they provided freely, and use of which was taken to be a marker of pain!).
